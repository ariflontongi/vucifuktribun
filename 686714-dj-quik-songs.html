His 1991 debut album, Quik Is the Name, produced two DJ Quick songs that reached the Billboard Top 20 R&B singles chart. The album also went Platinum. Quik’s success would continue throughout the ‘90s as he dropped a handful of classic G-Funk albums.</p><p>The rap icon has earned his status as a pioneer in hip-hop through his distinct voice and multi-layered music. His production has influenced countless beat-makers over the decades. His lyrics continue to be the zenith of gangsta rap artistry. Impressive DJ Quik songs are in no short supply, but here are seven tracks that encapsulate one of the most influential careers in rap music.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-summer-breeze-1995>7. "Summer Breeze" (1995)</h2></span><p>“Summer Breeze” is one of DJ Quik’s best summer jams. Released in 1995 on his album Safe + Sound, “Summer Breeze” samples Jermaine Jackson’s classic hit “You Like Me Don’t You.” It’s a perfectly crafted, smooth, laid-back track that puts listeners in the headspace of chilling on the beach.</p><p>It’s also one of the more “radio-friendly” tracks from Quik. It eschews tough tales from the streets for introspective lyricism about lost summer days. Quik’s flow, the soulful vocals on the refrain, and mellow instrumentations make "Summer Breeze" a must-play at any summer cookout.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-jus-lyke-compton-1992>6. "Jus Lyke Compton" (1992)</h2></span><p>The lead single from DJ Quik’s second studio album Way 2 Fonky is an illustrative homage to his hometown in a roundabout way. Released in 1992, "Jus Lyke Compton" paints a vivid yet anecdotal picture of how <a href=# rel>gang culture</a> exists across the country. Quik’s sharp and sardonic lyrics glide over a smooth and funky beat the entire track. The song’s deeper meaning might be easy to miss due to being a head-nodding banger.</p><p>However, heads who give a closer listen will hear Quik playfully chastise various cities for being “Jus Lyke Compton.” It’s a wonderful example of introspective gangsta rap that meditates on how tales from the streets can come from all corners of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-loked-out-hood-1991>5. "Loked Out Hood" (1991)</h2></span><p>“Loked Out Hood” is a classic G-Funk anthem by any measure. From its funky, fast-paced beat to Quik’s rapid-fire bars, the track remains one of the genre's finest examples. Quik’s smart and illustrative lyrics about gang life are on full display here. While the track wasn’t one of the singles from DJ Quik’s debut studio album, Quik Is the Name, it has become a classic jam. “Loked Out Hood” sampled funk acts like B.T. Express and P-Funk All Stars, showcasing Quik’s knack for finding incredible songs to chop and screw. This one’s a banger, through and through.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-dollaz-sense-1995>4. "Dollaz + Sense" (1995)</h2></span><p>“Dollaz + Sense” is a classic jam that encapsulates the essence of West Coast gangsta rap. From DJ Quik’s second album, Safe + Sound, the track tackles money, power, and bitter rivalries within the rap game. With its tongue-in-cheek title, “Dollaz + Sense” has become an all-time classic from DJ Quik’s vast library of songs.</p><p>Songs like “Dollaz + Sense” helped propel Safe + Sound to No. 1 on Billboard’s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. Decades later, Long Beach rapper <a href=# class=text-word rel>Vince Staples</a> would pay homage to the song on his 2022 album Ramona Park Broke My Heart. That track was appropriately titled “DJ Quik.”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-put-it-on-me-2002>3. "Put It On Me" (2002)</h2></span><p>“Put It on Me” is an incredible collaboration between two West Coast Rap icons. The song originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 2001 film Training Day. It would later be released on DJ Quik’s sixth studio album, Under tha Influence, the following year. The track was produced by <a href=# rel>legendary rapper/producer Dr. Dre</a>, who might be the only West Coast figure to meet DJ Quik’s greatness. Dre lays down a couple of verses, but the lion’s share of rapping comes from Quik’s bravado. The song was a hit single and helped propel the Training Day soundtrack to No. 3 on Billboard’s Top Soundtracks chart.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-pitch-in-on-a-party-2000>2. "Pitch In On A Party" (2000)</h2></span><p>“Pitch In on a Party” was the lead single from DJ Quik’s fifth studio album, Balance & Options. The track is a party anthem that effortlessly blends funky basslines, a catchy hook, and snarky rhymes. Quik’s ability to craft songs with broad appeal through universal themes of throwing down on a good party is in full effect here.</p><p>With a classic G-Funk beat and Quik’s sharp lyrics, “Pitch In on a Party” is an infectious track that encapsulates the spirit of wild gatherings. This track is a banger for any house party or summer bash and represents some of Quik’s best latter-day work.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-tonite-1991>1. "Tonite" (1991)</h2></span><p>“Tonite” is a West Coast banger that embodies the vibrant sounds of G-Funk. With its funky beat and sultry hook, the track has become an enduring classic within the genre. The song reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks charts and helped propel DJ Quik’s debut album, Quik Is the Name to classic status.</p><p>The song recently appeared in the 2023 film, You People, starring Nia Long, Lauren London, Eddie Murphy, and Jonah Hill. The opening beat of the track is an earworm that even casual listeners will recognize. It’s hard to determine which DJ Quik song has the longest legs, but “Tonite” is a track that is larger than life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbYN4fZNmm6Nloaq2rHnSqKWgqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
