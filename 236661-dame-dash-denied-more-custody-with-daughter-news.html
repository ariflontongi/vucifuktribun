The former couple&nbsp;was married from 2005 to 2009 and have two daughters together: 19-year-old Ava and 11-year-old Tallulah.&nbsp;Roy was awarded sole custody of the girls and while Dash has visitation, he petitioned the court to extend that time now that his work schedule has changed. Dash recently filed paperwork&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">asking the court to reevaluate</a> his&nbsp;custody rights for Tallulah, but according to&nbsp;The Blast,&nbsp;things didn't turn out in his favor.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The judgment came in Tuesday that “there are no material changes in circumstances, therefore [Dash’s] Request for Order regarding modification of child custody and visitation is denied.” After Dash submitted documents stating that he remarried as made time in his schedule to be with his daughter, Roy<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> fired off a response </a>asking for the judge to deny his request.
