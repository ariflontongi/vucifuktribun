"Your eyes are very close together ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è," the mother of two remarked, shutting down unsolicited feedback with quickness. "Yeah she really should have minded her business on this one Ms. Badu," one of the singer's loyal supporters gassed her diss up.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-negative-response-earns-clap-back-from-the-healer>Negative Response Earns Clap Back from "The Healer"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the early hours of Tuesday (February 13) morning, Erykah Badu sent out another tweet addressing those offended by her words. "And if [you] mad about that tweet... Unfollow me. I don't trust people with no sense of humor. Beat it," she confidently declared.
