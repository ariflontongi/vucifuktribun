She instead wore a Loewe gown custom-made for her to look like wood, styled by Ryan Hastings.</p><p>“I’ve always wanted to be a tree, and tonight that’s what I’m trying to do,” she joked in an interview on the Vogue livestream with model <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/ashley-graham-met-gala-hair/>Ashley Graham</a> and actress Gwendoline Christie, alongside fellow Loewe girl Greta Lee prior to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/2024-met-gala-every-look/>hitting the red carpet</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o72484tP3jhTYhPnP9cgan-1920-80.jpg><p>The Bones and All star said that she and Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson cited marquetry, or the process of layering thin sheets of wood, as an inspiration for her gown. The gown's trompe l’oeil bodice was painted with delicate brown flowers wrapped around her waist and stomach before giving way to a draped white skirt.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://vogue.com/article/taylor-russell-2024-met-gala referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Vogue</a>, it was created using a process called hydro sublimation, which the brand previously used to create its Spring 2023 collection. The bodice was custom-molded to her body for a perfect fit.</p><p>The wood accents continued into her hair: her updo featured matching wooden flowers. Her glam comprised of equally-earthy tones with dewy bronzed skin and sleek, graphic winged eyeliner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GMuk6MHB7NMCmB9tqxdQ44-1920-80.jpg><p>Rusell and Loewe have long been interlinked. She opened the brand's Spring 2023 show in Paris and has recently earned a global ambassador title. The British brand sponsors tonight's Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, so my eyes were peeled for the celebrities the brand chose to dress.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

Most recently, they <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/harry-styles-taylor-russell-it-bags-couple/>doubled up on the It-bags of the season</a> while walking in Brooklyn, New York.</p><p>The night is still young, and the Met Gala isn't known for being predictable. Will the duo make a chic red carpet debut later this evening? Only time (in the garden, of course) will tell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJ6RqLWqu81oq5qxnKS%2Fbr7UrKqepJxixLC7w2abq52jqHqtu8SwnGallal6qK3LmmRraGJpfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
