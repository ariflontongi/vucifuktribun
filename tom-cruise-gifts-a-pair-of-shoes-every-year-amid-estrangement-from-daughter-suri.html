Tom played Ray Ferrier, and Dakota starred as his daughter, Rachel. Reflecting on their time together, Dakota recounted her 11th birthday on set, when Tom gifted her her first cellphone, a Motorola Razr.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2971ad698392-tom-cruise-dakota-fanning-war-907227710.jpg><p id=eUrxb_GZSIA data-wc=28>"I wanted a Razr so bad, and I must have been talking about it a lot because that's what he got me," Dakota reminisced.

"I'm learning every day, and I have been since the minute I became a mom."</p><p id=evXk_dhSEBnP data-wc=38>She has also shared insights into Suri’s personality. "I love her so much. My biggest goal has always been to nurture her individuality.
