Williams was performing Aldean’s song, “Tattoos on This Town.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: Hollywood’s Memorable Mea Culpas</a></strong></p><p>Williams’ rep told <a href=# rel=nofollow>USA Today</a> that Williams felt his performance was not “adequate,” and said that he wanted to honor his friend Aldean that night. “Turning in a poor performance would only ruin that effort.,” said the rep.</p><p>Williams issued his own statement, telling <a href=# rel=nofollow>Country Weekly</a> that “I’ve heard people mess up my songs and screw up [Hank Williams Sr.] songs. I was here to honor Jason, a kid I really like. When I walked out there, it didn’t feel right, it didn’t sound right. I didn’t want to disrespect him.”</p><p>Aldean ended up re-performing the song without Williams. Aldean joined<strong> Brad Paisley, Kenny Chesney,</strong> Lady Antebellum and <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> as this year’s nominees. The show will air on December 13 at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p><strong><a href=#>STORY: ESPN Permanently Cuts Hank Williams Jr. From ‘Monday Night Football’</a></strong></p><p>Hank Williams found himself in the media spotlight after he made surprisingly sharp comments about President Obama on Fox News’ Fox & Friends in October.</p><p>The singer started in with a political discussion, saying Speaker of the House John Boehner’s golf game with President Obama was “one of the biggest political mistakes ever.”</p><p>“It’s like Hitler playing golf with [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu,” he said.</p><p>Soon after, Williams’ song “All My Rowdy Friends” was pulled as ESPN’s Monday Night Football opener.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKmtzaRksKGcobaiudJmoatlp5a5rL%2BMqJ2fZZOiwW6%2F05qenmVia4R4gZho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
