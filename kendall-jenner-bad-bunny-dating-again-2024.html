"There wasn't ever any drama in their breakup and they missed each other."</p><p>A second insider said that the model and musician (whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) were "not on the same page in life" when they broke things off, adding, "It's like they needed the break to miss each other enough to figure things out. They always had this crazy attraction to each other. Things are great again."</p><p>During their time apart, there were reports that Jenner was exploring other romantic options, with the second source saying, "Benny was not happy that Kendall was dating" and wanted to get back together.</p><p>"Kendall is happy," the source said of their reunion. "Benny is very charming and is always sweet to her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dys6euCxDgb8rigBWVpxVE-1920-80.jpg><p>Jenner and Ocasio have been fueling reunion rumors for a few weeks, after they were spotted cuddling up to each other at a Met Gala after-party (that's the first Monday in May, for the uninitiated).</p><p>After that, an eyewitness told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/kendall-jenner-looks-cozy-with-ex-bad-bunny-2024-met-gala-afterparty-8644465 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>People</a>, "They were sitting together, laughing and having the best time."

They even <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/kendall-jenner-bad-bunny-gucci-campaign/>starred in a Gucci campaign together</a>, which is kind of the pinnacle of romance for a supermodel.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/bad-bunny-kylie-jenner-relationship-ends/>The two's December breakup</a> was more a reflection of their priorities in life than of how well their relationship was going, according to sources. One insider told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.etonline.com/kendall-jenner-and-bad-bunny-break-up-after-less-than-1-year-things-fizzled-out-between-them-source referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Entertainment Tonight</a> in December, "They both knew going into this that it likely wouldn't be a forever type of relationship and that was mutually understood from the get-go. They have crazy busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down."</p><p>Apparently, this wasn't reason enough for them to stay separated. Happy for them!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MHF2YHDYbTh4d4J8ZAPXNV-1920-80.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGijlaOxorjLZqGepp6av26uwJ1km62eo8ZusMCtoKefXZa0orXNZmlpamRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
