Virtually nothing is known about who raised her, although there are claims that she was not an only child, spending her childhood with step-siblings.</p><p>What is even more interesting is that there appears to be no information about where she graduated high school.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">W Magazine</a>, she graduated from the University of Florida and even began to prepare for a Ph.D. When she grew weary with fighting with her first love, science,&nbsp; she headed down the road to where she is now and moved to California to pursue acting.</p><p>Her very early childhood appears to have a lot blacked out or unknown, which makes her earlier life fascinating.</p><p>Her birthday is July 14, 1989, and her middle name is Ena. Some think she comes from an African American and Latino family, but there is no information to confirm that.</p><p>Wainwright, with her stellar start to her acting career, bears a striking resemblance to Alicia Keys. Still, there is no evidence or way to confirm that they are related, especially when one considers that this young woman up to this point has been a new face in Hollywood. Her time as a dedicated mother on Raising Dion is sure to change this, however.</p><p>Raising Dion is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiZnJ7Aqa2MsJiipqentqi002auoaddnsBuwMeeZKuZmai2r7OMnaCopl2owaK%2BjJqlnWWnncZusM5mp56noKGybsDHoqWkZaOdsm610mapnqSRqbKledOoZJqkmZi2onnKnrCsZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
