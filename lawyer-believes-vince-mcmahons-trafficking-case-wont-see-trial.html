Now, an eminent lawyer claimed that the lawsuit won’t even go to trial.</p><p><a href=#>Serious allegations of sexual trafficking and misconduct have been filed against Vince McMahon</a> by former WWE employee Janel Grant. The lawsuit alleges that McMahon shared explicit content of Grant without her consent, involving other WWE employees, unnamed executives, and stars. Additionally, it claims McMahon directed her to engage in sexual activities with them.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>Sportskeeda’s UnSKripted podcast</a>, lawyer Dmitriy Shakhnevich provided insight into the likelihood of a settlement rather than a trial. He mentioned that statistically, well over 90% of cases settle, suggesting that based on these numbers, it is probable that a settlement will be reached in this situation,</p><p>“So statistically speaking, well over 90% of cases settle. So, if you are just going by the numbers, this will probably settle.”</p><p>Moreover, the lawyer addressed the possibility of the civil case evolving into a criminal one in the future. However, he further sated that there’s no reason to jump to conclusions already.</p><p>“Could it? Yes. And we don’t know if that process is going anywhere at all, right? What we know now is that he hasn’t been arrested. That’s all we know… The allegations here do kind of sound criminal. And so, is it possible? Sure. We can’t again jump to that conclusion. That will simply be unfair to do.”</p><p>Ari Emanuel is already ready to&nbsp;<a href=#>eliminate threats after Vince McMahon’s resignation</a>. <a href=#>RVD also provided his observation on the disturbing allegations</a> in McMahon’s lawsuit. We will have to wait and see what will become of McMahon in the end.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you think of what the layer had to say?
