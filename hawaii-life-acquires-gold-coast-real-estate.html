Having watched the growth and acquisitions by Hawaii Life with quality companies and individuals, I knew that this was the right direction,”</span> Persons said.</p><p>He noted Hawaii Life’s high-tech features and global affiliations with both Christie’s International and Luxury Portfolio International as specific reasons for the sale.</p><p>Corey Ayres, spokesman for Hawaii Life, said that while it is an acquisition, Gold Coast has <span class=quotations>“chosen to join their family and hang their licenses under the shingle, so to speak, for a variety of reasons; chiefly it’s for the exposure and marketing they offer them and their clients.”</span></p><p>Terms of the acquisition, which closed Oct. 8, were not disclosed.</p><p>Persons will remain broker in charge of Hawaii Life Gold Coast, and Jeanie Schmaltz will be the broker in charge who manages the Gold Coast team for Hawaii Life, Ayres said.</p><p><span class=quotations>“We are excited to welcome Don Persons and his team of Oahu real estate agents to Hawaii Life. Their reputation and huge client base attest to the quality of work and service they’ve provided, and the relationships that they’ve built over the past few decades,”</span> said Matt Beall, Hawaii Life CEO and principal broker. <span class=quotations>“We look forward to working with them, and to enhancing their clients’ experience with cutting-edge marketing, technology and global reach.”</span></p><p>The Gold Coast consists of residential condominiums and cooperatives built in the late 1950s and ’60s.
