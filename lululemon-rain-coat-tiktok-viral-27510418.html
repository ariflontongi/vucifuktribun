The most viewed video about the coat has more than 20,000 views on the video platform.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lululemon Rain Rebel Jacket</a> is the garment that's taken the internet by storm. It's available in pink, black, and blue, with the latter having sold out.</p><p>The pink version is going quickly too, with only sizes 16 to 20 available. For the black coat, sizes zero, two, four, 10, 14, 18, and 20 and still up for grabs.</p><p><b>READ MORE: </b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>'I shopped the FatFace summer sale and found a £125 waterproof jacket for £60'</a></p><p>While the coat usually costs £198, it's <a href=# rel=nofollow>currently on sale for £134.</a> It has 4.7 stars from 63 reviews, with one person writing "This is such a great jacket . Stylish and rainproof with lots of pockets . Perfect for anyone in the UK who likes hiking / dog walking whilst still looking good."</p><p>Another wrote "great jacket, stylish and great fabric, chic rainwear, who knew that rain coats could give you so much confidence". However, another shopper added "I ordered a jacket in size 12 which is the size I normally wear. When I tried it on, the sleeves were far too long (almost covering my thumbs) and the jacket felt like, at least, one size too large."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article27510405.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Screenshot-2023-08-12-173115.png><p>TikTok users have also been enamoured with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Rains' Curve W Jacket</a>. It costs £105 and comes in seven colours, but reviews aren't available.</p><p>If those coats seem too expensive, Amazon has several alternatives. A tan <a href=# rel=nofollow>Rageman coat</a> costs £19.99 on Amazon and comes in sizes L to 3XL.</p><p>One person wrote "This is really rather nice! I’m a size 14 and the large fits fine. Great that you can pull in the ties inside and that gives it a snug shape then.</p><p>"Poppers as well as a zip are good too, so you can just use a few poppers if you prefer. It’s got a nice feel to it, wouldn’t feel shabby at all in this. Lightweight with a lining, always a bonus."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article27510403.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_61Z4pqP2EEL_AC_UY879_.jpg><p>However, another person said "This is actually a lovely jacket and I have received compliments. It's particularly great for those in-between seasons days. The main reason I have marked it down a bit is that is absolutely not rainproof. It's good for light rain showers but in heavier rain you will still need your umbrella!"</p><p>The <a href=# rel=nofollow>YFFUSHI coat</a> costs £39.99 and is also highly rated. One person said: "Lightweight and waterproof. Great for everyday wear. Would have given 5 stars except that the waist pull cord on the inside of the coat does not have toggles on the end to stop it disappearing into the seam that pulls the waist in."</p><p><b>You can buy the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lululemon Rain Rebel Jacket</a> for £134, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Rains' Curve W Jacket</a> for £105, the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Rageman coat</a> for £19.99, and the <a href=# rel=nofollow>YFFUSHI coat</a> for £39.99.</b></p><p><b>Sign up to MyLondon's Going Out Out for the very best of what's going on in the city <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rsXLqKWdp55ju6bD0mijop6VqMG6uMRonZqrmJ68r3vLrqOupJWivK950Zqgp2WTpK61edOioq2nm2LDqr7ApWRrb2VmfXV9lw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
