The game was first announced a couple of years ago by AEW EVP Kenny Omega. Since then, there has been a lot of speculation about the game.</p><p>Now with the game in the final stages of production, <a href=#>AEW revealed some gameplay footage</a> from the game over the past several weeks. Many fans still have a lot of questions regarding the game.</p><p>One question that seems to be on everyone’s mind is the roster. Many fans are excited to see which AEW wrestler they will be able to play as. Another question many fans had was regarding the game’s release schedule. Many people were curious to know if the game will be a single release with digital updates or will there be an annual release much like WWE games.</p><p>Fightful spoke to Evil Uno at Wrestlecade. Evil Uno, who has been active in the development of the game said that he is of the belief the the AEW Fight Forever Game will be a single release and will evolve over time. He also confirmed that there will be a roster of 50 characters and that would be added over time. Evil Uno also mentioned that Danhausen won’t be in the initial release of the game.</p><p>AEW Fight Forever doesn’t necessarily have a release date at this moment, but we have learned about some plans for the game in the future. Evil Uno has worked closely with the game, and spoke with Fightful at Wrestlecade about what he could reveal. While it’s been rumored and speculated in the past, Uno said that he is of the belief that the AEW Fight Forever game will be a single release that will constantly evolve over time.</p><p>This is instead of an annual or recurring release that would require the purchase of a new game for each edition. He even said that the “Fight Forever” name plays into that. He also confirmed what we’d heard before, that there would be a roster of over 50 talent, and that would be added to over time as well. Danhausen is one name we learned won’t be in the initial release, as he appeared a little too late to be included in the first run.</p><p>AEW Fight Forever is shaping up to be a promising game. If all the reviews about the game are to be believed, then this could be on of the best wrestling games in a while.
