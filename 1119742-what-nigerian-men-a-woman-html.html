They put in a lot of effort and do all they can to get the attention of the male population and look appealing to them. But sometimes, you might not get the result you need. So before you waste time and efforts in vain, it's better to find out; what do Nigerian men like in a woman.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt490o011eq28.jpg><h2>What do Nigerian men like in women?</h2><p class=align-left>Whether you want to accept this or not, the representative of the stronger gender pay attention to appearance. Any person will access another on first sight. Very often it is erroneous, but we perceive 80% of information with the help of eyes. But do not be upset if you do not consider yourself beautiful. Beauty is a relative concept, and every man has his own ideas about it. Therefore, instead of worrying, think about other aspects such as cleaniness and tidiness. If your hair is always clean and your clothes are neat and tidy, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6f02ec4e30b683a4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 of the best women empowerment quotes to inspire you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is worth noting that men do not like excessive makeup and painted lips because no one likes to eat lipstick when kissing. The ideas imposed by glamorous magazines about what men like in women aren't based on the objective reasons, opinions and preferences of the guys, but due to the desire of these companies in the world fashion industry and cosmetic products to sell as many goods as possible. Most men like natural female beauty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6f02ec4e30b683a4.jpg><p class=align-left>Don't worry about your figure. A fit body is beautiful, of course, but slightly protruding tummy and ample curves can be pleasing to men. A beautiful figure doesn't depend on weight. The main thing is not to lose shape.</p><p class=align-left>A special source of interest in the female appearance is a bust. Although movies and media try to convince us all that only big bust can attract a man, it's not true. Most of them prefer it if it isn't bigger than their palms. Owners of a small bust should feel good because they can walk around without a bra, and as long as you look good overall, you will attract men.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb6877e8e7afa773.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best tips on how to get a girlfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> How to romance a lady?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6kpia1sak2t.jpg><p class=align-left>Another important aspect is character. Beauty, body and face only creates a first impression. No man will like a woman who frowns always no matter how beautiful she is. She must be self-confident, feminine and aware of her own attractiveness. When a woman loves herself, it also transmitted to the men around her. They look at her with interest and it doesn't matter at all whether she suits the standards of beauty from magazines or not.</p><p class=align-left>The inner beauty is reflected in eyes and smile of a woman. So, such beauty is even more important than appearance. As they spend time together, a man begins to recognize the inner world of the woman he likes. If it turns out to be deep and meaningful it will increase the chances of continuing this relationship. Men also like a good woman so kindness, mercy, compassion, and empathy are very important for them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/210f6c1f09d667b7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Useful healthy lifestyle tips for men</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb6877e8e7afa773.jpg><h2>Top-7 things Nigerians love in women</h2><p class=align-left>● You should be simple and easy to be around.
