I was just looking at him thinking, 'That is for better or for worse isn’t it?' I looked a state, he was sleeping on the floor because I was on the couch, I couldn’t even get up the stairs. If he can carry me to the toilet then he’s a keeper."</p><p id=eqEauKqJM4r5><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eadae4c6caf9-alesha-dixon-family-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=edrZlk7S0NBe data-wc=8><strong>Alesha Dixon shares two children with&nbsp;Azuka Ononye</strong></p><h2>Does Alesha Dixon have children?</h2><p id=e7xitGSsaJPI data-wc=75>Alesha and Azuka currently have two daughters, Azura Sienna, six, and Anaya Safiya, who will turn one in August.
