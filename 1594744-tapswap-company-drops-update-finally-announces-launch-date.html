The main reason for this delay is that we've uncovered many bots. That earned an unrealistic amount of Shares. To maintain justice in token distribution. We're taking measures to stop and ban these bots."Our top priority is ensuring fair allocation of TAPS and rewarding those who've earned them honestly. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to keep the integrity of our community."<p class=align-left>Legit.ng spoke to Fidelis Ozuawala who said it confirmed his earlier assertion that miners using bots would be weeded out.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/005efbaa239dae5c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Notcoin: Young lady earns money from new crypto mining, hits 2.5 million coins on Tapswap</span></p></a>"Yes, this is great and welcome development, to weed out fake earners so that the rewards will be beneficial for those who really did the tasks. At this stage, Tapswap would do anything to profit its real users because their hype is truly one of a kind. Ordinarily, they would need more time to process their decision on the beneficial ecosystem to launch the token-- especially one offering them more backing and support."<h2>Reactions as Tapswap postpones pool launch date</h2><p class=align-left>@Maliqifeoluwa said:</p>"So what should I tell my car dealer wey I don promise now?"<p class=align-left>@daniels_osi said:</p>"Anything una dey do, sha lunch because... If you carry us play tete, sacrifice straight."<p class=align-left>@cryptoquween said:</p>"July 1st? Not so bad.
