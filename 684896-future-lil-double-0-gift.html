A video surfaced this week of Future handing over goodies to the young rapper after his release from jail. Double 0 came home to a stack of cash and new jewelry, including an iced-out watch and Freebandz chain. “That shit go with it. Turn my dog up. Just got out the slammer turn my dog up, man,” Future said with a grin on his face. Double 0 replied, “Turn that shit up a whole another notch. They know that.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Lil Double 0 has been a rising force on the Freebandz roster but his legal issues have undoubtedly stagnated his journey. Last December, police arrested the “<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Good On Love</a>" rapper on drug and gun charges. However, in February, he turned himself into authorities before his release earlier this week. Meanwhile, Akademiks alleged that Lil Double 0 was potentially <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">facing a 15-year prison sentence</a> as paperwork revealed that he was charged with trafficking oxycodone, possessing MDMA, driving without a valid license, and unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-future-gears-up-to-release-new-music>Future Gears Up To Release New Music</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Besides ensuring that his artists are taken care of, Future appears to be plotting on the release of new music. Last year, we received his latest full-length album,<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> I Never Liked You</a>, which served as one of the highest-selling projects of 2022. Along with the success of “Wait For You” ft. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> and Tems, Future continued to claim his reign at the top of the charts. However, there has been further anticipation surrounding his next effort.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a> and Future have been hinting at the release of a collaborative project in the near future. On several occasions since the top of 2023, the two have hinted at releasing a joint project together. Metro even said that it would see the light of day in 2023. Although no release date has been set, Metro has been cooking up the soundtrack for Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse which he confirmed will include a new collaboration with Future. We’ll keep you posted on any more updates on the project.&nbsp;Check out Future's welcome home gift to Lil Double 0 above.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
