She shares six-year-old twins – daughter Monroe and son Moroccan – with her ex-husband Nick Cannon, 37. Although the pair split in 2014, they remain good friends, with Nick telling People magazine in January that they "love each other unconditionally". They certainly looked sweet at the Kids' Choice Awards over the weekend, where the proud parents twinned – with their twins! Mariah and Monroe wore identical chic black leather jackets paired with white tops and black skinny jeans. And like father like son, little Moroccan looked equally as cool as he matched his dad in an orange and white tracksuit.</p><p id=ebVBt1D19im6 data-wc=14><strong>MORE: Mariah Carey joined on stage by twins Monroe and Moroccan: see sweet video</strong></p><h2>Fergie turns 43</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1d73d6b92ae5-fergie-celebrity-birthday-26-march-z.jpg><p id=eapmkpBtvm9l data-wc=135>The Black-Eyed Peas star Fergie – born Stacy Ann Ferguson - recently shared a throwback snap with her 4.4 million Instagram followers, proving she has hardly aged at all as she turns 43. The star, who shares four-year-old son Axl with her ex-husband Josh Duhamel, may well be celebrating with a joint party as her mum celebrated her birthday just four days ago. She wished her glamorous mum, Terri, a Happy Birthday by sharing a sweet snap of the pair from the 2012 Grammy's. The Big Girls Don't Cry hitmaker released her second debut album in September last year. Last month, Fergie's bandmate will.i.am confirmed her departure from the band after 15 years, saying "We are now a trio. I don't know why Fergie isn't on the project. You will have to ask [her] that".</p><p id=eLZBb5r1pbZm><a class=hm-link href=#>RELATED: Fergie opens up about heartbreaking effects of her drug addiction</a></p><h2>Jessie J turns 30</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/066a72f7e54f-jessie-j-celebrity-birthday-march-26-z.jpg><p id=edTBnRdXaie_ data-wc=116>It's a big birthday for Jessie J this year – she's turning 30! And the popstar is certainly proud to be an Aries; it's the first thing she says in her Twitter bio: "I am and Aries. I am an Essex girl," she tells her 9.2 million followers. The Price Tag singer has had a busy lead-up to her birthday, recently telling fans via Instastories: "Until my birthday, I will be in bed". It looks as though Jessie has an exciting year ahead of her. She is set to release her fourth album R.O.S.E later this year, and is currently competing in Singer 2018, a singing contest in China watched by 250 million people every week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQcWdsamdphHR9j2ianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaKqpJ2xosXSZmlwZZ2Wv6S0jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
