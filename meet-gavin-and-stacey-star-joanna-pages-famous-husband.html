She explained: “We spent the whole of the first lockdown arguing and threatening to divorce each other.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1r75vCIJK5 data-wc=91>“Then we went through a month of literally not saying a single word to each other. We came out of that a bit numb and deadened and desperate for anything we could get because we just argued so much. ‘Let’s get some sex in before we have to pick the kids up from school’ — that’s how desperate we’d got.’ I’m sure all parents found it really difficult during the lockdown. You’re with the children so much, and then at night-time, they all just wanted to sleep in bed with us.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7afb23d720a2-gettyimages-903458114.jpg><p id=eAmao7nvN2hO data-wc=67>When asked if she has “sexy times” at the weekend in an interview with The Guardian, she joked: “Oh God, not with four children! If I did have a spare hour, I’d sit and watch the Australian version of The Traitors rather than muster up any energy to have some sexy time. My husband would have a different answer, but he’s not breastfeeding a two-year-old right now.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Gavin and Stacey: What have the cast been up to since the last episode" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9a04d8823162-gavin-and-stacey-cast-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Gavin and Stacey: What have the cast been up to since the last episode" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Gavin and Stacey: What have the cast been up to since the last episode</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="6 questions that need answering in the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d67f5a1102a5-p089sdqb.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="6 questions that need answering in the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>6 questions that need answering in the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Gavin and Stacey to return with last ever episode in 2024 Christmas special - details" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/13abce3379ab-gavin-and-stacey-4-d.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Gavin and Stacey to return with last ever episode in 2024 Christmas special - details" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Gavin and Stacey to return with last ever episode in 2024 Christmas special - details</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h3>Do they have any children?&nbsp;</h3><p id=eehn0pEzN7Bn data-wc=57>Joanna and James share four children, welcoming their daughter Eva in 2013, and sons Kit and Noah in 2015 and 2016.

My husband takes our eight-year-old to rugby, where they eat bacon sandwiches – it seems easy. I have to get our 11-year-old ready for hockey, where I look after our seven- and two-year-olds. Usually, I haven’t washed or eaten.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
