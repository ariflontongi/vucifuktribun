At the event, The Miz teamed up with his tag team partner John Morrison to take on Bad Bunny and Damien Priest, but they were defeated.</p><p>The match, however, was heavily praised by many fans and critics, most particularly Bad Bunny’s performance. Towards the end of the bout, Bad Bunny hit John Morrison with a Candian Destroyer on the floor to the surprise of everyone watching. According to The Miz, the spot was originally supposed to involve him instead of Morrison.</p><p>During an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Looper</a>, the former WWE Champion said he refused to take the Candian Destroyer because he himself doesn’t know how to perform the move, and it wouldn’t make sense to let Bad Bunny perform it on him when the latter doesn’t know how to do it either.</p><p>“When they brought it up, I was like, “absolutely not.” One, because I can’t even do a Canadian Destroyer, let alone Bad Bunny doing one. But man, that was an incredible move. And the way John [Morrison] got hit with it, I was in awe. I mean, you see the look on my face. It’s like, did that really just happen like that? I did not expect it to look like that at all. It was magical. Incredible. And yeah, kudos to Bad Bunny because I don’t think I could have done it that well.”</p><p>After WrestleMania, Bad Bunny returned to his musical gig while Miz and Morrison continued feuding with Damien Priest. At WrestleMania Backlash, The Miz collided with Priest in a Zombie Lumberjack match before being devoured by the zombies. Miz reportedly tore his ACL during the match and is expected to be out of action for some time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ye49uZmpwX6m1pnnMorFmqpWrsqK40mauobFdnbJuvsSfrKydlGLBsHnTmqKeZaSdsm6vwKeYnaGRo3qlsdKtqaixlad6p77OpmSbmZRir7a6zbJkmqxdrL%2Bmv9OlnKaZnp6ucA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
