If you watch Hannah Waddingham on the hit Apple TV show or if you gasped over her many costume changes during Eurovision, you will have noticed her incredible skin. And it's not down to invasive skin treatments either as the 48-year-old actress is afraid of needles.</p><p id=eWRiWB-HTSU data-wc=45>But she's not afraid of finding an impressive regimen, and the mum-of-one recently showed off her favourite skincare products in a <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">video for Harper's Bazaar magazine</a> where she talked about the lavish skincare she loves, but showed off the budget skincare she swears by too!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0a52d77cb972-hannah-waddingham-eurovision-shutterstockeditorial13911123cj.jpg><p id=eLsbbsH0dm7 data-wc=24>In fact, we were in awe as she raved about <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Weleda Skin Food Light</a> - a moisturiser that's just £11 - such a bargain.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3d522263c74e-hannah-waddingham-weleda.jpg><p id=e2QMFn6WQtO data-wc=68>Describing the daily moisturiser as "a really good basic thing that I absolutely love," she said: "Absolutely brilliant on flights and just a real all-purpose. It's like my version of Elizabeth Arden 8 Hour. You can put it on your elbows, put it on your lips, really gorgeous and smells fabulous. You can use on your legs, but it's something that always keeps my face calm and moisturised."</p><p id=e_7IXE7KGLG data-wc=92>The broadway star also revealed that she is a real skincare fan. "I've kind of fallen in love with skincare, being in my mid-forties I try and mix and match things that are more expensive and less expensive. I'm absolutely obsessed with very very good products - no rubbish in them. And there are some things in my regime that are more low key and then other things I spend the pennies on because I don't want to ever have any intrusive things done to my face because I'm scared of needles."</p><p id=eDv1vfjvB94 data-wc=77>Weleda Skin Food Light also counts <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Hailey Bieber and Victoria Beckham</a> as fans, <a class=hm-link href=#>as well as Michelle Keegan</a>.
