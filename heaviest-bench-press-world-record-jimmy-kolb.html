I currently hold 6 active All Time World Records, including the heaviest single lift in powerlifting history with plans to achieve many more.</p><p>''I have met some of the greatest people in the sport and have had the&nbsp;privilege of learning from and lifting beside them. Now that I am out of the US Military, I am focusing my passions on helping others increase their bench press.''</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Sport</h2></p><p>He added: ''Bench press has been my passion since I first started powerlifting. Like most lifters I started out doing all three lifts and even managed to get a 2410lb total at 218 when I was just 20 years old.</p><p>''But soon after that I realized that I didn't enjoy or need the <a href=#>squat </a>or <a href=#>deadlift</a>, and from there my bench only career began. Now it is my goal to help others increase their bench press, whether they are equipped or non-equipped.''</p><p>Klob also founded KolbStrong - ''&nbsp;a one stop shop for all things bench press''.</p><p>For Â£9.50 per&nbsp;month, subscribers can join the Klobstrong community to learn from the best bencher in the world.</p><p>On his Klobstrong page, he writes: ''Whether you are new to benching or have been around a while, this community is for you to learn and get stronger together. I am here to help YOU, and look forward to providing as much value as I can from week to week.''</p><p>And it appears the strongman's busy schedule doesn't stop there - he also the ''Klobstrong Power Podcast'' - which see's him talk all things benching, as well as interviewing young athletes to help get their name out to the world as they begin their powerlifting careers.</p><p>Aside from his successful fitness journey, Klob is also lucky in love.</p><p>He is married to Kate, who has supported him on and off the platform for the last 12 years, as both his wife and training partner.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, the couple have created the Klobstrong scholarship - providing young athletes $1,000 each and a powerlifting goodie box in a bid to help with their powerlifting dreams.</p><h2>Is benching too heavy dangerous?</h2><p>Of all the main barbell lifts, the&nbsp;bench press&nbsp;is the most dangerous - especially if you're benching a heavy weight.</p><p>If the bar slips from your hands during the lift, the loaded barbell can cause severe injuries - and in the worst cases, can prove to be fatal.</p><p>With this in mind, it's of the upmost importance to ensure you always have a spotter around when benching a heavy weight - if you fail a lift, they can quickly assist in getting the barbell off your body.</p><p>If you're benching alone it's important to always use a power rack that you can attach safety arms or pins to.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>This will ensure you can break out between the barbell and the bench to safety in the event of an accident.</p><p>Lifting heavy can also cause injuries when your form isn't right, when you push yourself too hard or exceed your limits.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK570qmmq6xfa4Z1f5dubmiglZbDqrHSrWSbnZ6YtW680Z6qrGWnpL%2BtsIyrnJynopl6q7XMprBmo5%2Bhr3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
