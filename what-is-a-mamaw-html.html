Both words rhyme with the word “law.” When I was younger, I remember seeing it spelled (by a relative of mine), and they spelled it “pa-paw,” however it should be emphasised that the two syllables are pronounced exactly the same.</p><p></p><h3>What are some good names for grandfathers to use?</h3><p>Big Daddy is the traditional name for a grandfather.
