Some fans even wanted Gil to take over as host of the Married at First Sight after show to continue to see him on screen.&nbsp;</p><p>Hosting a Married at First Sight aftershow may not currently be in the cards for Gil, with Keshia Knight Pulliam now taking the reigns as Afterparty host, but Gil could return to reality television.&nbsp;</p><p>During Gil’s Q&A, a fan asked, “Will you ever try out for any other Reality Shows?”</p><p>Gil replied with a poster for The Amazing Race.

I’m going once a month now since it’s been a year now. I believe I’m healed. My continuance with therapy now has to do with self growth and learning new ways to control my thoughts for when life throws a curve ball.”&nbsp;</p><p>Married at First Sight airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on Lifetime.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5eeuW6v1J6pqGWimsOmrcusZKGdo2KxosDIp55mmZeWtq95wKebZquYlr%2Bmv4ywn6KbmGK%2Fpq3LoquyZaOdvLh5x56bZqyirnqvsdetZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
