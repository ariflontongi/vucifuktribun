The court was told his wife was unable to be present but maintained her support.</p><p>Although the 31-year-old was due to be sentenced on Friday afternoon, Judge Tanya Smith said a number of issues needed to be resolved first.</p><p>She cited concerns with the particularisation of one of the charges, which had been “rolled up” to include using a carriage service to both solicit and transmit child sex abuse material.</p><p>Judge Smith said she was trying to determine what conduct was subject to which element of the charge, and whether the combination was legal.</p><p>“If I determine it’s not permissible by law, there would need to be an election made for one or the other charges,” she said.</p><p>If that were the case, crown prosecutor David Jordan said making a choice may “unwind” Gwynne’s guilty plea and “leave uncharged conduct which remained to be charged”.</p><p>The judge also raised discrepancies between the definition of a child under state and commonwealth law as a factor she is required to consider during sentencing.</p><p>She noted the matter “raises a lot of issues” and explained she was taking great pains to assess each charge instead of approaching Gwynne’s offences on a “holistic basis”.</p><p>“Some of the topics that are discussed are obviously very depraved but … it’s my job to sentence for an individual charge that’s before me and what conduct it is in respect of,” Judge Smith said.</p><p>“I’m not here to sentence somebody in terms of overall having beliefs or fantasies of a certain type.”</p><p>Judge Smith adjourned the matter for a week to allow the parties to make submissions on the issues raised.</p><p>If her concerns are adequately addressed, the court heard Gwynne will likely be sentenced before the end of year.</p><p>The 31-year-old looked dejected and attempted to evade the media as he left Campbelltown Courthouse with his parents.</p><p>On Friday, NSW Police confirmed Gwynne resigned from the force on August 23, more than six months after he pleaded guilty.</p><p>He was busted after investigators from the Human Trafficking Investigators Task Force posed as a fictional 15-year-old American girl on Whisper.</p><p>Gwynne initiated a conversation with the ‘teen’ in April 2022, and asked if she would “sit on a cute Australian cop’s face”.</p><p>The ‘teen’ made it clear she was only 15 years old before the cop sent her a photo of his erect penis next to his NSW Police uniform shirt.</p><p>Days later, police searched Gwynne’s home and Waverley Police Station and found several items he had been wearing in the images sent to the ‘teen’.</p><p>The disgraced police officer pleaded guilty to grooming a child outside Australia to make it easier to engage in sexual activity.</p><p>He also admitted to using a carriage service to solicit child abuse material, three counts of using a carriage service to transmit child abuse material and using the service to offend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwutKwZJqbpGSwsMHRrapmpJGsfLG7y6KanmWfm7Oqr8Srqmasp57AtbHDZqCnm5WowW6tzZ1km52jqbaiuMitsGaekaPBor%2FInqpmqpWrsqK4xJ1mp52nqHq0wM6rsGidk2x%2FpH2SapybnmWXfaKDlJ9pbJySm4KnhcVsnHCZkg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
