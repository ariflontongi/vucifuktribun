Though Nicki isn’t on the air on a daily or even weekly basis, she continues to use the platform to speak her mind. As a result, the <a href=# rel>Amazon AMP show</a> remains a major success as fans await to hear Nicki chime in on topics, whether music related or otherwise. AMP, in fact, gained some significant momentum by tapping Nicki, who previously partnered with Apple to debut her show.</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems as though Nicki harbors some resentment toward the company as they haven’t provided her equity. There’s no doubt that she opened the doors for other artists to get their own shows on the platform, which she feels is worthy of giving her a bigger bag. In alleged leaked audio that surfaced, Nicki forgot her microphone was still on when she aired out her frustrations towards the company while mentioning her “<a href=# rel>WTF</a>” collaborator.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-nicki-minaj-say-about-nba-youngboy>What Did Nicki Minaj Say About NBA Youngboy?</h2></span><p>Though Nicki didn’t have any issues with NBA Youngboy’s radio show, she explained that she deserved some equity in AMP for bringing artists on board. “Now they're getting other artists, like NBA Youngboy, all this stuff because of me. Didn’t give me equity in it, didn’t give me shit,” a voice that sounds like Nicki says. “All I said was, ‘Hey, you guys, now that I see what it is and now that I realized you used me –,” the recording continues until someone screams “Hey” and tells her that the microphone is still on. “Hello? Fuck!” she says.</p><p>At this point, Nicki hasn’t issued any statements regarding the alleged snippet but the release comes at an interesting time. This morning, NBA Youngboy and Nicki Minaj released their third collaboration together, “WTF.” The two previous connected on <a href=# class=text-word rel>Mike Will Made It</a>’s “What That Speed Bout” before later teaming up on NBA Youngboy’s “I Admit” off of Ma I Got A Family. We’ll keep you posted with any further updates on Nicki Minaj’s Queen Radio. Check out the alleged leaked audio above. Does Nicki deserve equity in AMP?
