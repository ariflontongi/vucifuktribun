In fact,&nbsp;Ye's verse was so strong that he may very well have done the impossible, which is to say outshining his collaborator <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kendrick Lamar</a> -- not exactly an easy feat, given Kendrick's status as one of the greatest&nbsp;emcees of all time.</p><p>True, it's probably more debatable than concrete -- but still, it can't be denied that Kanye didn't bring his A-Game over the Madlib produced banger.
