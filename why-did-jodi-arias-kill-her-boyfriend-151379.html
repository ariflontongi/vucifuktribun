Details on the Murderer's Case</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>It’s been nearly 10 years since <a href=#>Jodi Arias</a> killed her boyfriend, Travis Alexander. The case, which wasn’t tried until 2013, captured the nation’s attention due to Jodi’s shocking claims about what went down that day in Mesa, AZ.</p><p>The 37-year-old has technically <a href=#>been in jail</a> since her arrest on July 15, 2008, but wasn’t convicted of first-degree murder until May 8, 2013. Now that Investigation Discovery is revisiting the case with its new TV series <a href=# title=_self>Jodi Arias: An American Murder Mystery</a>, true crime aficionados are wondering why Jodi killed the man she supposedly loved. <strong>Scroll down to learn more about her complicated story.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jodi-arias-travis-alexander.jpg><h2>Why did Jodi kill Travis?</h2><p>Jodi claims she killed her boyfriend in self-defense. “The simple answer is that he attacked me,” she said on trial, “and I defended myself.”</p><p>However, that wasn’t always her story. In interrogation tapes obtained by <a href=# title=_self>ABC News</a>, Jodi said she didn’t hurt him. “If Travis were here today, he would tell me that it wasn’t me.” She added, “If I was going to ever try to kill somebody, I would use gloves. I have plenty of them.” And finally, “I don’t think I could stab him. I think I would have to shoot him.”</p><h2>How did Jodi kill her boyfriend?</h2><p>The 30-year-old Morman businessman was stabbed 27 times, his throat was slit so far he was nearly decapitated, and he was shot in the head.</p><h2>How many years did Jodi get?</h2><p>In 2015, Jodi was <a href=#>sentenced to natural life in prison</a> after two juries could not reach a unanimous decision on whether or not to sentence her to death. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens could have given her life in prison with the possibility of release after 25 years but ultimately chose a harsher sentence. After the announcement, the victim’s sister, Tanisha Sorenson, shouted, “Burn in hell!” Jodi is currently incarcerated at Arizona State Prison Complex – Perryville.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJorqGxXZm2pXnJqJuiZZGntqK%2FjKSgpaRdnbKzecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXmQbmhsb2lk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
