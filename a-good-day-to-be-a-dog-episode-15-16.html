However, this triggered the curse and Han Hae-na turned into a dog. Jin Seo-won, who was terrified of dogs, ran away from her, leaving her heartbroken.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lee Bo-gyeom, who had a crush on Han Hae-na, found out about her secret and decided to help her.

He went to Lee Bo-gyeom’s house and asked for Han Hae-na. Lee Bo-gyeom lied to him and said that she was not there. He then locked Han Hae-na in his room and attempted to kiss her. However, Han Hae-na bit him and escaped. She ran to Jin Seo-won and jumped into his arms. Jin Seo-won overcame his fear and hugged her. He then kissed her, breaking the curse and turning her back into a human.</p><p>The upcoming episodes will show the aftermath of this dramatic event. Will Han Hae-na and Jin Seo-won be able to stay together without any more obstacles? Will Lee Bo-gyeom accept his defeat and move on? Will the other characters find out about the curse and the truth?
