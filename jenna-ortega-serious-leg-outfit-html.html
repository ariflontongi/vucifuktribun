In a pair of posts on Instagram, Ortega shouted out to Thom Browne for designing the head-turning outfit, as well as her hair and makeup team and Vogue Magazine.</p><p>After appearing in bit parts in many film and television shows dating back to 2012, according to IMDb, Jenna Ortega got her biggest break yet by portraying the titular sardonic emo teen in the Netflix series <a href=#>Wednesday</a>. In the nine-episode first season, Wednesday attempts to master her newfound psychic abilities while solving a years-long mystery, circumventing a killing spree in the process. While attending Nevermore high school, Wednesday taps into her powers while clashing heavily with adult figures around her, including her therapist and the school’s principal.</p><p>Since starring as the oldest Addams child, Ortega has gone on to find major success in other horror-inspired projects such as Scream VI. Jenna Ortega’s upcoming IMDb credits include leading roles in a crime thriller called Finestkind, written and directed by Brian Helgeland, as well as a romantic drama titled Winter Spring Summer or Fall. The young star also has a placement in an untitled film project starring The Weeknd, and a rumored appearance in the <a href=#>Michael Keaton</a>-led Beetlejuice 2.</p><p>The Instagram posts showcasing the young star’s Met Gala outfit were shared from Jenna Ortega’s official account, which boasts an impressive following of more than 40 million users. The first post currently holds more than 6 million likes, while the second post, shared just a day later, showing Ortega approaching the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s historic stairs, currently has 5.5 million likes. Each post touts over 17,000 comments from Ortega’s adoring public, with <a href=#>Game of Thrones</a>‘ Gwendoline Christie, Undone‘s Constance Marie, and even the official Facebook account chiming in to sing her praises.</p><p>Jenna Ortega also tagged her fashion designer, Thom Browne, who can be seen admiring his work in the back of one of the photos. Browne styled a number of popular figures for this year’s Met Gala, including Pusha T, Teyana Taylor, and Succession‘s Alexander Skarsgard. Browne’s latest collections seem to make use of sharp contrast between black and white, as seen in Ortega’s gold-accented skirt, as well as his other styles worn this year by former Daily Show host Trevor Noah, The Last Of Us‘ Bella Ramsey, and Glass Onion‘s Janelle Monae.</p><p>With Jenna Ortega’s career on a steady rise, there’s no way of knowing what kind of major heights she hopes to achieve next! For now, we’ll be following along as the young Wednesday Addams actress prepares to deliver a number of excellent performances in her upcoming projects, combined with her impeccable fashion choices, as displayed on her Instagram page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnmpq7r62MqKmtnZeWerSx0aKmrqtdobKoec6uq5%2BhpGO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
