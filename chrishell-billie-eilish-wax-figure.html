It attempted to capture her in a green ensemble and her iconic dark hair with lime green roots.</p><p>The icon herself has not responded to the new wax figure unveiling, but recently headlined at Glastonbury Festival over the weekend.</p><p>On June 24, she used her stage to protest against the US Supreme Court’s 6-3 ruling to overturn Roe v Wade.</p><p>The landmark case gave women the right to abortion as it allowed people the protection to make a choice about their own bodies.</p><p>Billie made history by being the youngest performer to ever headline the festival – with Paul McCartney later making his own record by being the oldest at 80. But the young star used her time at Glastonbury to express her angry over the court’s decision.</p><p>She said: “Today is a really, really dark day for women in the US. I’m just going to say that, because I can’t bear to think about it any longer.”</p><p>She then sang Your Power, where the lyrics reference people taking advantage of younger people in and out of relationships.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xXaOyuL%2BOnJ%2BroaOdsq24jKyrmq2jmnyktNGiqqGdnKF6o7XLpaCeZZWeuaq%2Fx2aumrBdm7aowdGe</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
