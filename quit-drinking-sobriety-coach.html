Alcohol alters our brain chemicals</strong></h3><p id=eRD7EBkV-2v data-wc=23>"Going sober can significantly impact our happiness by altering the dopamine and serotonin levels in our brain," explains certified sobriety coach Christy Osborne.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eWkwYQ3ODOI data-wc=60>"When we consume alcohol, our brain is flooded with a large amount of dopamine, more than we get from everyday enjoyable activities. This excessive dopamine raises our pleasure baseline, meaning our brain requires more dopamine over time to feel pleasure. Consequently, activities that once brought us happiness feel dull and boring. Alcohol becomes the primary source of pleasure and happiness."</p><h3><strong>2. We can learn to enjoy the simple things</strong></h3><p id=eibQZzi9C5u data-wc=13>Christy explains that by swerving alcohol, we're able to enjoy simple pleasures again.</p><p id=eE7V2QFvuHA data-wc=34>"Without alcohol, our pleasure baseline gradually lowers meaning that you can begin to enjoy things like, a walk in the park, or a nice meal, or a holiday without a drink in your hand."</p><p id=ebq-0o908F data-wc=10><strong>DISCOVER: <a class=hm-link href=#>24 of the best alcohol-free and low alcohol drinks</a></strong></p><h3><strong>&nbsp;3.

Work out why you drink – and why you want to stop</strong></h3><p id=edVF0NKxTFKz data-wc=12>Get curious about yourself and understand why you want to stop drinking.</p><p id=ebq1e6BoLSc5 data-wc=34>If you believe that there is a benefit to alcohol, however small, you will continue to drink. That's why we start with the 'why'. Why do you drink? Why are you pouring that glass?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0889b050209c-happy-friends-soft-drinks.jpg><h3><strong>2. Ask yourself if alcohol is helping you reach your goals</strong></h3><p id=eaHLCSlEbeBw data-wc=50>This might take a bit of research. For example, if you are drinking to ease anxiety you may feel relief after the first drink, but after the initial dopamine spike wears off, adrenaline and cortisol take control and you end up making yourself feel more anxious than when you started.</p><p id=eDFxG_GlwV6H data-wc=27>Go through your list of why you drink one by one and do an experiment to see if alcohol is helping you achieve those things or not.</p><h3><strong>3. Think of quitting drinking as an experiment</strong></h3><p id=ecIwpHeQdN3W data-wc=30>You never have to say forever, but if you are sober curious or considering stopping drinking set yourself a temporary challenge to see how you can feel better without it</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/176dfbfa27ba-cheers-mocktail.jpg><h3><strong>4. See how you're feeling without drink</strong></h3><p id=eiS1ycftVnFV data-wc=36>When you've been alcohol-free for a few weeks, take a look at how life alcohol-free feels. That way, you can compare the two and you get to decide whether or not the alcohol is serving you.</p><h3><strong>5. Find sober activities you enjoy</strong></h3><p id=esIOimka7_Be data-wc=54>If you’re worried about missing out on social interactions with people through not drinking, take a look at social activities that you can do without alcohol. Suggest different activities to your friends as they might also be interested in joining you on this and it can be a way to reframe your time together.</p><p id=eK_AN8EX8rTB data-wc=13><span><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><a class=hm-link href=#>5 ways to make every day special – and feel instantly happier</a><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p><h3><strong>6. Reframe your beliefs</strong></h3><p id=e0_4OaqJFa22 data-wc=36>Many of us believe drinking makes things more fun, mainly because there is a huge social element to drinking, especially during the winter months. Venturing into the festive period when you're not drinking can feel daunting.</p><p id=eIiRUVlc_F8T data-wc=53>Think about what your blocks are and why you feel events might not be as fun without alcohol. It can be as simple as reframing thoughts and realising you’ll feel much fresher in the morning and able to remember the evening than not.
