During the episode, she talked about Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart's first audition together to see if they had the necessary chemistry to pull off the relationship between Edward Cullen and Bella Swan. Apparently, the question of whether the duo had chemistry became moot after they jumped into a kissing scene while laying on a bed. Hardwicke described how Pattinson "fell off [the bed] and landed right there on this floor." The moment was so intense that the director's reaction was, "Dude, calm down." She was also concerned about any illegal activity occurring between the two actors since Stewart was underage at the time.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>The New Yorker</a> in November 2021, the "Spencer" actor recalled swooning over her co-star the moment she saw him. She added that what she felt for Pattinson was "what anybody playing those parts needed to feel." The on-screen connection Pattinson and Stewart felt instantly for one another eventually expanded beyond the movie set and the two dated for four years, from 2009 to 2013, as per <a href=#>Page Six</a>. In an interview with <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> in November 2019, Stewart admitted that Pattinson was her "first love." Unfortunately, their relationship didn't last forever like Edward and Bella's and <a href=#>the duo broke up after Stewart cheated</a> with&nbsp;"Snow White and the Huntsman" director Rupert Sanders.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGtpZ392e9OwoKWhl53BbrDIq5ycrJ%2BneqS7zZ%2Bgq6WjYsSprdNmrp5lo6rAsbHCrZydZZGXvLbAjKumm52iqXqxrdOtoKern6N6orrDZqKroaOpsq950q2csJmiqcBuu81mqp6sXZi8r7rEnKuip55k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
