The series, starring Lily-Rose Depp as a pop star who falls under the sway of a Hollywood club owner (Tesfaye), suffered mostly negative reviews from critics, and viewership fell short of some other recent HBO shows.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“The Idol was one of HBO’s most provocative original programs, and we’re pleased by the strong audience response,” an HBO spokesperson said in a statement. “After much thought and consideration, HBO, as well as the creators and producers have decided not to move forward with a second season. We’re grateful to the creators, cast, and crew for their incredible work.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A decision on whether to renew or cancel The Idol was in flux until recently, sources say. There was no set plan for a multiseason story, though there were options to continue the show following the end of the five-episode first season.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I know this was never scheduled to be a limited series.” co-star Da’Vine Joy Randolph, who was added as part of a <a href=#>creative overhaul</a> spearheaded by Levinson,&nbsp;<a href=#>told The Hollywood Reporter</a> after the finale aired.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Of that finale, THR critic Lovia Gyarkye wrote that it “felt like the conclusion to an <a href=#>altogether different show</a>.” Gyarkye also noted, “There’s an unintentional aimlessness to the series, which contradicts its projected confidence.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Created by Levinson, Tesfaye and Reza Fahim, The Idol took a tortuous path to HBO. Midway through production in April 2022, the series underwent wholesale changes that saw director and executive producer Amy Seimetz and several castmembers leave, with extensive reshoots. Levinson ended up directing the entire season and was credited with the teleplays for all five episodes, as well.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In March, three months ahead of the series premiere, a <a href=#>Rolling Stone story</a> detailed a litany of issues with the production, from last-minute rewrites to what some members of the production felt was an overemphasis on the toxic relationship between Depp’s and Tesfaye’s characters. HBO and the show’s team pushed back on the allegations, with Tesfaye calling the reports <a href=#>“ridiculous.”</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">After a premiere screening at the Cannes Film Festival in May, The Idol made its HBO debut on June 4, pulling in <a href=#>913,000 viewers</a> across all platforms for its premiere night. The audience for the first episode grew to 3.6 million after a week, but first-night ratings for subsequent episodes fell off some. HBO says that in the 85 days since the series premiere, the first episode has grown to 7 million viewers, but it hasn’t released a figure for the full five-episode run.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Idol marks a relatively rare one-and-done for HBO, joining the likes of&nbsp;John From Cincinnati,&nbsp;horse racing drama&nbsp;Luck,&nbsp;music industry series&nbsp;Vinyl,&nbsp;Alan Ball’s&nbsp;Here and Now&nbsp;and more recently,&nbsp;Lovecraft Country&nbsp;and Joss Whedon’s&nbsp;The Nevers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Levinson, Tesfaye and Fahim executive produced The Idol with Joe Epstein, Kevin Turen, Aaron Gilbert for Bron, Ashley Levinson, Nick Hall, Sara E.
