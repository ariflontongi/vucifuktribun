Usually, the DHL office you visit or the online shop issues the sender of the goods a link that assists in the tracking process. You, therefore, can track the status of your cargo through the company’s online portals or via the website.</p><p class=align-left>For you to track your cargo, you also need a tracking ID or number. The tracking ID is a combination of letters and/or numbers that identifies each shipment. When you send the items, the online shop or merchant should provide you with the tracking ID. If you are purchasing an item from an online shop, the shipment notification that is sent to your email contains the tracking ID.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4b0967b469a388fc.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top details about the amazing Wakabet NG: how to register & play</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>NB: </strong>It is important to note that not all shipments have a tracking ID.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d86fcd27e128402c.jpg><p class=align-left>Usually, your tracking events become visible within one or two days after you receive a confirmation from your online shop or merchant. Sometimes, the shipment status appears to stagnate. This does not mean that the shipment process has stalled. The goods continue to travel to the destination, but this information may take time to reflect on the tracking system.</p><p class=align-left>There are unique cases where the tracking status may not change, and the parcel or goods are delayed. Such cases are beyond the control of the company. They include weather events or local disruptions such as public holidays or strikes. All customers are advised to contact the merchant or online shop if the cargo does not arrive within ten days post the anticipated delivery time.</p><p class=align-left>In case your tracking number fails to work, you should contact the company. The staff members will assist you accordingly. Customers can also track more than one tracking ID via a single request.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/76a2e5d0036252d0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All you need to know about shipping goods from Nigeria to the USA in one post</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7128fefe844ef2b1.png><h2>Delivery</h2><p class=align-left>DHL has collaborated with the postal provider in Nigeria to deliver your parcel. If you are exporting a product, the company’s collaborating partner will make the delivery. Usually, the time of delivery is dependent on the type of product and the destination. Neighbouring countries, for instance, have a shorter delivery period compared to countries that are long distances away.</p><p class=align-left>Once your order is confirmed, the approximate delivery time will be visible on the website. If you fail to receive the cargo on the approximated date, you should contact the company. All customers should be aware that they cannot alter the delivery address once the shipment has been dispatched.
