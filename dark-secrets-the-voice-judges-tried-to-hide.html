The EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony) winner began her career on "American Idol," which made her the perfect person to step in as a coach on Seasons 13 and 15 of "The Voice." Former reality singing competition series contestants make great mentors, and the American version of the show has now hosted a number of them, including Kelly Clarkson, Niall Horan, and Camila Cabello. Hudson was the first former reality star on "The Voice" USA, though, and for that she deserves props. She also served as coach for three seasons on "The Voice UK" during roughly the same time period, memorably throwing a shoe whenever she was really impressed by a contestant's performance.</p><p>Hudson's career has evolved in ways no one could have predicted — she's currently a talk show host, for example — but while she has been lucky in Hollywood, she has been tested on the personal front. In 2008, Hudson's estranged brother-in-law broke into a home and killed Hudson's mother, brother, and nephew. William Balfour was found guilty of all three murders in 2012, after a trial where Hudson herself testified, but this sort of tragedy is not the kind of think one can ever get over. "It literally just takes a part of you," Hudson said on "<a href=#>Oprah's Next Chapter</a>" in 2019. The star rarely discusses the slayings in interviews but when she does, you better get your tissues out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxoaX90hY6dmKujXaiypL7ErapmrJiaere7yJycZqKlmbSmv4ytqaKdlGLBsHnHopueZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
