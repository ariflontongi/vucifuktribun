These charming jewel-tone compacts offered endless imaginative play for children of that era, but they also posed choking hazards, causing concern for watchful parents.</p><p id=eF6qRrXpcCJ8 data-wc=86>Over time, as kids moved on to newer toys, many Polly Pocket was discontinued and sets were stowed away, collecting dust in attics and closets. However, in a surprising turn of events, around 2018, a wave of nostalgia swept through, and Polly Pockets made a triumphant comeback. Mattel, the company responsible for these treasured toys, introduced a new line, marking the first such release since 1997. Suddenly, almost three decades after their initial debut, vintage Polly Pocket toys became highly sought-after collectibles in the resale market.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/354a3def7b25-gettyimages-1017749106.jpg><p id=e-vG9nV4TjnD data-wc=39>Many of the older sets made before 1998, when Mattel took over production from Bluebird, have become especially valuable. Online platforms like eBay now showcase these cherished sets, with prices ranging from $400 to $800 for mint-condition, sought-after collections.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5Nyb3BqYmSyt7HRsquhoZ6cerixjKSlqK9dlq%2BwwdNmo6KkqWKwsLjLoqWsZaCkua3FjKmmnKOVqXquu9WinGarn2Kzor6O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
