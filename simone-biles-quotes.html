Below are some of her most well-known quotes that represent both her competitive spirit and her quest for balance and wellness.</p><h2 id=instagram-2015-3>Instagram, 2015</h2><p>"Work hard in silence let&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/-ZSs4XQXF5/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>your success be the noise</a>"</p><h2 id=refinery29-2016-3>Refinery29, 2016</h2><p>When asked what&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/05/110017/simone-biles-interview-gymnastics-olympics-2016 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>advice</a>&nbsp;she has for women inspired by her: "I would say to make sure you always have fun [with what you're doing], and to make sure that it's your decision. If it's not your decision, you're not having fun, and if you're not having fun, you might not enjoy it. If you're having fun, that's when the best memories are built."</p><h2 id=usa-today-2016-3>USA Today, 2016</h2><p>On getting&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/rio-2016/2016/06/02/simone-biles-expectations-rio/85298782/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>competition experience</a>: “A successful competition for me is always going out there and putting 100 percent into whatever I’m doing.

Whenever you’re up there, it feels like it’s just you, your team, and your equipment. Before I go out and compete, my mom always says ‘be the best, Simone,’ but other than that, there’s nothing special that I do. I’m just myself.”</p><h2 id=vogue-2020-6>Vogue, 2020</h2><p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.vogue.com/article/simone-biles-cover-august-2020 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>young women who look up to her</a>: "No matter how good you are in your sport, in life, in work, the number one thing people talk about is how you look ... You’re still going to thrive. You’re going to become somebody amazing and great. You guys are all beautiful, inside and out.”</p><p>"Growing up, I didn’t see very many Black gymnasts ... So whenever I did, I felt really inspired to go out there and want to be as good as them. I remember watching Gabby Douglas win the 2012 Olympics, and I was like,&nbsp;If she can do it, I can do it.”</p><p>On holding gymnast officials accountable: “Personally, for me, I don’t think of it as an obligation ... I think of it as an honor to speak for the less fortunate and for the voiceless. I also feel like it gives them power.”<br></p><p>“We can’t feel comfortable promoting our sport if we fear that something might happen like this again because they’re not doing their part. And the hardest part for us is we’ve always done our part. We’ve always represented the U.S. to the best of our ability, and all the time, most of the time, every time I’ve represented, come back with gold medals. It’s like:&nbsp;We’ve done our part.

And that's my problem: when people kind of harp on other people that are good at something. And it's like, everybody can say you're good, but once you acknowledge it, it's not cool anymore. And I want kids to learn that, yes, it's okay to acknowledge that you're good or even great at something."</p><h2 id=tokyo-olympics-2021-3>Tokyo Olympics, 2021</h2><p>On pulling out of the team final: "I have to put my pride aside.
