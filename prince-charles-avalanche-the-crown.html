Though Diana was fortunately not on the slopes that fateful day, Charles was, but miraculously avoided being caught in the snowslide, which injured one member of their group and killed another, Major Hugh Lindsay, a former aide to Queen Elizabeth. Here's the true story of the avalanche and its aftermath.</p><h2 id=was-prince-charles-trapped-by-the-avalanche-3>Was Prince Charles trapped by the avalanche?</h2><p>Luckily, no, though he was on the slope when it happened; meanwhile, Diana and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/sarah-ferguson/>Sarah Ferguson</a>, who was then married to Charles' brother <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-andrew/>Prince Andrew</a>, had stayed back to spend the day in the party's chalet.

After the snowslide had ceased, Charles and the rest of the group immediately began digging out the two trapped skiers. Lindsay was reportedly pronounced dead on arrival after being airlifted to a hospital in nearby Davos. When Charles was rescued from the slope by another helicopter, he was reportedly "visibly distressed" and "weeping," according to eyewitnesses that included the helicopter's pilot.</p><p>According to a June 1988&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-06-27-mn-3813-story.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>report</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Los Angeles Times, a subsequent investigation found that while Charles could not be charged for Lindsay's death and Palmer-Tomkinson's injuries, his entire group was determined to be at fault for the accident, since an avalanche warning had reportedly been issued that day, and the group had willingly followed Charles, a very experienced skier, down a challenging, unmarked slope.</p><h2 id=how-did-charles-and-diana-react-to-the-accident-3>How did Charles and Diana react to the accident?</h2><p>The royals and the rest of their group cut their trip short and returned home shortly after the avalanche, with Diana telling her&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://www.amazon.com/Diana-Her-True-Story-Words/dp/1501169734 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FDiana-Her-True-Story-Words%2Fdp%2F1501169734%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon>biographer</a>&nbsp;Andrew Morton that she took charge of the plans since her husband was still very shaken up by the accident.

However, Lindsay's widow did speak out about the onscreen depiction of her husband's death.</p><p>Horsley, who was six months pregnant with their daughter at the time of Lindsay's death and was then working in the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/buckingham-palace/>Buckingham Palace</a> press office,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/11/21/widow-condemns-use-fatal-klosters-ski-disaster-crown/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>told</a>&nbsp;The Sunday Telegraph&nbsp;that she contacted Netflix in advance to ask them not to dramatize the horrific accident. "I suppose members of the royal family have to grin and bear it, but for me it's a very private tragedy," she said. Horsley reportedly received a "very kind" letter in return explaining that while the show's creators understood her wish, they couldn't grant it, but hoped that she would "feel that they deal with difficult subject matters with integrity and great sensitivity."</p><p>Horsley said she was "horrified" at the prospect of her husband's tragic death being recreated onscreen, noting that she was especially worried about its potential impact on their daughter (whose godfather is <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-charles/>Prince Charles</a>). "I won't be watching it, it's just too upsetting to see something like that," she said, adding, "Perhaps at some point in the future, Alice and I will watch it quietly together. It will be tough. My daughter has only heard about the accident from me, because she wasn't even born when it happened."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomGxsaGWEdnyXaKeroZ6Ysm6vx5qppZ2jYq63rcuapZyglWLBqbGMnKmor55k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
