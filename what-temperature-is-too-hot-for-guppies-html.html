Any hotter than 85 degrees and your guppies will start to overheat, suffer from overheating symptoms, and may die.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></h3><h3><span lang=en-us>Similarly one may ask, what temperature can guppies survive in?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>Keep guppies’ water temperatures between 74 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit. These optimal water temperatures are similar to those of most tank fish. Aquarium residents generally succeed in temperatures that are in the range of 70 to 80 degrees.</span></p><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>Also, can Guppies live in 60 degree water?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>Keeping Guppies in Cold Water Their ideal temperature range is set between 72-82 °F (22-28 °C). That said, guppy fish can survive in lower temperature water that goes as low as 60 °F (15 °C). They keyword here is survive, which is far from thriving or enjoying water at that temperature.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>Similarly one may ask, do guppies need heat?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>Guppies are tropical fish and they like warmer water. So, do I need a heater for my guppy fish tank? The short answer is, YES! You need to heat the water for your guppies, unless you live in a tropical climate, where the temperature does not drop under 68 °F (20 °C).</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></h3><h3><span lang=en-us>Can Guppies live in unheated tank?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>Guppies can do well in unheated tanks as long as the room temp is constant, but I wouldn’t risk Platies or Mollies.</span></p><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span lang=en-us>37 Related Question Answers Found</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>Can Guppies live in 85 degree water?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>Can Guppies live in 85 degree water? Guppies are hardy tropical fish and can survive a wide range of water temperature, It is recommended not to keep them in water hotter than 82 °F / 28 °C as the oxygen level becomes very low and the fish can suffocate as a result.</span></p><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>Is 82 degrees too hot for guppies?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>Guppies require the water to be between 74 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit in the wild. Guppies can handle water temperatures as low as 63 degrees Fahrenheit and as high as 87 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>Do guppies need a bubbler?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>Guppies are one of the hardiest tropical freshwater (and even saltwater!) fish you can keep. But they can’t breathe air, so they need well-oxygentaed water, like most fish. If you have a filter with the output stream close to the surface, or with an output that breaks the water surface, an air pump is not needed.</span></p><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>Do guppies need light?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>Guppies need light to thrive during the day, but constant light can actually kill them. Set your tank light on a timer so that it goes out and night and provides the guppies with time to rest and recharge. Provide hiding spots to reduce stress. To keep your fish healthy, they need to feel safe and secure.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>What is the lifespan of a guppy?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>Depending on the tank, water quality, food, stress levels, and other deciding factors, a guppy can live anywhere up to 5 years. Now, that is of course the absolute maximum lifespan of a guppy. Most guppies lifespan is anywhere from 1 to 3 years, with 2 years being the average and 3 years being very impressive.</span></p><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>What is the best temperature for guppy fry?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>The proper temperature for the guppy is 72° to 78°F. The pH can be kept between 7.0 to 8.0. When you are ready to breed them, raise the temperature 2° to 3°F.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>What is the best water for guppies?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>In most areas the tap water has a pH of 7.6, which is perfect for keeping guppies. However be careful when using tap water for your fish. Tap water usually contains chlorine and chloramine, which is low quantities, is not harmful for human use, but can cause significant damage in your fish, or even death.</span></p><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>Why are my guppies dying?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>The most common reason for guppies dying in your aquarium is the poor water quality. With feeding your fish you actually pollute the water in your tank. The lack of oxygen in the water can also cause guppies to die. Putting too cold or too warm water in your aquarium will cause death to your guppy fish.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>Do guppies kill each other?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>Although I haven’t seen it happening in my aquariums, guppy males can kill each other and even other fish too, especially if these other fish are added later to the tank.</span></p><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>Do guppies need Gravel?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>Many fish prefer tanks which have a vast amount of gravel so that they can swim within this. They also prefer many plants so that they can hide behind these. Guppies have no problem residing within tanks which have plants plus gravel. It also is not a necessary condition for your tank if you have guppies in it.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>How many hours do guppies sleep?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>8 hours</span></p><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>Do Tetras need a heater?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>Equipment: Neon tetras and cardinal tetras are tropical fish and require a heater that keeps the aquarium at about 72–80 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, they need a filter to provide a home for beneficial bacteria and to aerate and clean the water.</span></p><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span lang=en-us>How many guppies can you have in a 10 gallon tank?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>That said, your tank will hold around 7-8 gallons of water. An adult guppy can reach up to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), without counting their tail fins. So in 10 gallons of water you could place roughly 7 adult guppies (10 gallon / 1.5 inches = 6.66).</span></p><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en-us>Are guppies bottom feeders?</span></h3><p><span lang=en-us>If you are not overfeeding, Guppies will eat off the bottom too. They’re not finicky, usually. You don’t really *need* a bottom feeder with them.</span></p><p><span lang=en-us>&nbsp;</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6wn5qsXamyrrzEq5itraKaeqq%2FjK2mqGWYpMFuss6rZKCtoKW2pr%2BNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
