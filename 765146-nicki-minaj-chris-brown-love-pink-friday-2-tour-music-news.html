"This is so very appreciated. Wow. ü´∂üèΩ," Minaj wrote on X, formerly Twitter. As a result, many fans began to implore Minaj to bring out Brown during stops on her upcoming Pink Friday 2 tour. Nicki's 53-stop tour of North America and Europe begins on March 1 in Oakland. At the time of writing, the only confirmed guest act is <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Monica</a>, who will open all non-festival shows on the North American leg.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Minaj and Brown have seven collaborations together. Their partnership dates back over a decade to "Right By My Side" in 2012. Their most recent collab was Brown's "Wobble Up", also featuring G-Eazy, in 2019. Furthermore, their best charting was the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Money</a> track "Only", which went triple platinum and peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. However, their best-performing collab with no other featuring artists was Brown's 2013 "Love You More", which peaked at No. 23.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-chris-brown-claims-he-was-uninvited-from-nba-all-star-celebrity-game>Chris Brown Claims He Was Uninvited From NBA All-Star Celebrity Game</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The love from Minaj caps off a mixed week for Brown. The singer claimed he was uninvited from the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">NBA All-Star Celebrity Game</a>. "I was asked by the NBA to play in the All-Star Game this year! Only for them to call later and say I couldn't do it because of their sponsors like Ruffles. At this point, I'm sick of bothering me and I'm tired of living in the f-cking past," Brown wrote on Instagram. Furthermore, Brown claimed that after uninviting him, the NBA still asked him to sit courtside at the game. Brown posted an initial invitation from the league to appear at the game. However, he did not provide evidence of the league uninviting him.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It was the second major event in a week that Brown had seemingly been excluded from. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Usher</a> confirmed in a recent interview that he did not consider Chris Brown for a cameo at his Super Bowl halftime show. ‚Äú<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">No, I did not reach out</a> to Chris Brown. I‚Äôm not gon‚Äô tell you everybody I reached out to. I reached out to some hitters. I was curating what would be one of the greatest Super Bowls of all time and it actually turned into that because of who I reached out to," <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Usher</a> said.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
