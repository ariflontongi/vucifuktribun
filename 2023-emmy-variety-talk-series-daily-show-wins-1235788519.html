As it happens, 2023 was also Noah’s final year as host of the Comedy Central show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“This story has been so long, so crazy, so wonderful,” Noah said in accepting the award. “Thank you so much to the team and the person I always thank, the crazy genius, Jon Stewart. Thank you for calling me up and asking me to come join you on this crazy journey.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Noah also joked about breaking the win streak of HBO’s Last Week Tonight With John Oliver in the variety talk category. A rules change this year <a href=#>moved Last Week Tonight</a> into the scripted variety category (<a href=#>which it also won</a>), clearing the path for a new winner in the talk category for the first time since 2016.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I told you!” Noah exclaimed. “I told you we would beat John Oliver if he wasn’t in our category. We did it! We got rid of John Oliver!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Noah is the first person of color to front a winner for variety talk series and its predecessor category — outstanding variety, music or comedy series —&nbsp;since In Living Color, created by and starring Keenen Ivory Wayans, won the award in 1990.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Noah wrapped up his tenure at The Daily Show back in December 2022. But since the <a href=# id=auto-tag_emmys data-tag=emmys>Emmys</a> were delayed several months due to writers and actors strikes, the Television Academy is only now honoring the best in TV from the 2022-23 season. The Daily Show has still not named a permanent host and has been rotating through guest hosts for the past year.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The search for a host is apparently on Noah’s mind too: “When they announced that we had won, I was like ah, who is going to replace me?” he said in the Emmy press room. “That’s the second thing I thought of as well. I’m still thinking about that, and I will continue to think about it as I celebrate this amazing achievement.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The other nominees for best variety talk series were The Late Show With Steven Colbert, Late Night With Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Problem With Jon Stewart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOa2dra12auq7FjK%2BYq6GVqcZuwMClomarlae2pr%2BMnZiipKliwKm71mauoqajYn5zf5Rwb3FtYW58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
