It was not until recently that Tristan started paying child support.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Nichols originally filed for child support from Thompson in&nbsp;June 2021, claiming that the two had gotten together&nbsp;over his 30th birthday weekend while he was still with Khloé Kardashian. He denied the story until a DNA test proved otherwise.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In January, he confirmed that he is the father of Theo in a post on social media: “Today, paternity test results reveal that I fathered a child with Maralee Nichols. I take full responsibility for my actions. Now that paternity has been established I look forward to amicably raising our son.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Thompson is also the father of Kardashian's&nbsp;4-year-old daughter, True.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
