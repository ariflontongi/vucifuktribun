Speaking with <a href=#>CNBC</a> in 2019, the King of Bravo revealed that he has some spending habits the&nbsp;Real Housewives would surely approve of. In addition to his love of splurging on real estate, he has no qualms about traveling and doing so first class. As he told the outlet, "I don't want to sit in the back of the plane anymore. I just don't, sorry." However, the biggest gift he's ever given himself might just be a Rolex that friend John Mayer convinced him to buy.

"[Mayer] talked me into a watch that was outside of what I was thinking, but I'm glad I did it," Cohen shared. It was the perfect accent to his already impressive wardrobe, which includes a <a href=#>closet full of well-tailored suits</a> from some of <a href=#>his favorite labels</a>, including Calvin Klein Collection and <a href=#>Duckie Brown</a> whose T-shirts alone can retail for $150.</p><p dir=ltr>While he enjoys shelling out dough for top-tier items, Cohen revealed to CNBC that a luxury car wouldn't make his list of must-haves. Instead, he prefers to take the New York City subway to and from work because, in his experience, it's more efficient. "[A car is] a waste of money, it's a waste of time, it's a waste of gas," he proclaimed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcXBmZX96e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZZGjsbp5wqifnqZdnsBuvsSao6WxXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
