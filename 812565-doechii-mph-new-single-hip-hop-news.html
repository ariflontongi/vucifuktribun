Last year she scored the biggest hit of her career so far with "What It Is." Two different versions of the song one with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kodak Black</a> and one without have surpassed 100 million streams on Spotify. Earlier this year, she was included in a document of Top Dawg Entertainment artists who <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">are expected to release new albums this year</a>. It's not clear if her newest release will land on the eventual album, but that hasn't stopped fans from eating it up.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The track is called "MPH" and it's a short, right to the point banger. The song dropped overnight and it gets right to the point across a brief two minute runtime. The song has a dancy instrumental even as Doechii calls out her haters claiming that whatever they're doing, it isn't dancing. A few fans have speculated that some of the more pointed lyrics on the song could be aiming at <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Azealia Banks</a>. The pair went back and forth online earlier this year though it hadn't escalated to music yet. There's no real confirmation of any of that but in a year where rap beef has dominated the news cycle it wouldn't be too much of a surprise. Listen to the new song in its entirety and judge for yourself below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-doechii-goes-off-on-mph>Doechii Goes Off On "MPH"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Back in March, Doechii teamed up with JT for <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">another hard-hitting new single called "Alter Ego."</a> What do you think of Doechii's rapid fire new single "MPH?"
