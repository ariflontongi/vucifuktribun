Many people just assumed that Tina Knowles-Lawson must have really liked the look of their surname when naming the megastar, but Beyoncé and Solange's mother revealed that her daughter's first name is her maiden name. It's a moniker that she grew up disliking, but later learned to accept.&nbsp;</p><p>Dimitrios Kambouris / Staff / Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"A lot of people don't know that Beyoncé is my last name. I'’s my maiden name," she said. "My name was Celestine Beyoncé, which at that time was not a cool thing to have that weird name. I wanted my name to be Linda Smith because those were the cool names." That's not all; the last name "Beyincé" exists due to a clerical error that occurred when<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> Tina's brother was born</a>. Authorities refused to change it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I think me and my brother Skip were the only two that had B-E-Y-O-N-C-E," said Tina. She asked her mother why she didn't just get it changed to the correct spelling and her mother told her: "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">'I did one time.</a>.. I was told be happy that you're getting a birth certificate because, at one time, Black people didn't get birth certificates.'" So, Beyincé it was for one of her siblings and his children. No one seems to have a problem with it all these years, and generations, later.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
