Having worked with&nbsp;Beyoncé since 2007, some of Senofonte's&nbsp;most famous accomplishments include styling&nbsp;the "Formation," "7/11" and "Feelin' Myself" videos (you can thank her for Bey and Nicki's&nbsp;matching pink furs).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Lemonade, Senofonte fused influences from their southern environment in Louisiana with Victorian and "regal African" motifs. There was a lot of Gucci, vintage Alexander McQueen and Jean Paul Gaultier, but she made sure to mix in some high street fashion;&nbsp;Senofonte did this&nbsp;on "7/11" when she paired Forever 21 leggings under a Givenchy sweatshirt.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below are some key takeaways from the stylist's&nbsp;talk&nbsp;with NYT:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>On New Orleans' influence on the clothing:</strong> "If you look at the visual album, you will see an African influence that touches on her heritage, where she comes from...Beyoncé told me that in New Orleans—I don't know what the year was—black women were not allowed to show their hair. So that's where those head wraps came from."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>On why they chose a Victorian aesthetic:</strong> "We were thinking about being on those plantations at the time of her ancestors and what they would have worn. At the time, there was slavery, so it wasn't about that. It was about looking at these beautiful women that came from Africa and accentuating this beautiful culture and beautiful people."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>On&nbsp;Beyoncé's inspiration boards:</strong> "There was a lot of African print and gold.

And then in February, when we were starting to see the collections, the Balmain … everything just started to look like what we were doing."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>On Beyoncé's personality:</strong>&nbsp;"Don't let the country accent and the sweet smile fool you.
