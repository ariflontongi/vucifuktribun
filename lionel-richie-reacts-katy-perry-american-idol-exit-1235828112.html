My phone blew up,” Richie told Kimmel, also confirming that he wasn’t upset with the singer for unexpectedly dropping the news on the show.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Richie shared that he and fellow Idol judge Luke Bryan “didn’t know about it,” but her decision to exit “makes sense.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“In other words: The reason I love coming on the show here with you and the reason I’m doing American Idol is because I have 400 years of stories and a life in the music business. I have things that I’ve done,” Richie said. “And so when Katy says, ‘I want to go and create some stories,’ remember, she’s young. But the point is that you have to take some time and actually be an artist.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When Perry explained her decision to Kimmel, she reiterated that she loved the show, saying it connected her “with the heart of America.” However, she said, “I need to feel that pulse of my own beat.” When Kimmel asked what her fellow Idol&nbsp;judges thought of her decision, Perry had shared, “Well, they’ll find out tonight!” Perry later confirmed the exit news in an <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram post.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Perry has been a judge alongside Richie and Bryan since the singing competition was revived by ABC in 2018. No announcements have been made about who is considered to next join the judges’ table. When reached by&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter, reps for&nbsp;Idol&nbsp;had no additional comment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As for who he thinks will replace Perry, Richie noted that it’s being kept “tight-lipped.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I don’t even know, but I’m telling you … It’s gonna be really interesting. Only because, I’m telling you something, this is a great show. And what I love most of all is that we’re artists, so we know what we’re talking about, and these kids are scared to death, so I love sitting there as the wise pooh-bahs, the three of us, and we’re sitting there, and we’re all kind of giving information that we know is real.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Richie said that whoever comes to the judges’ table has to “be humorous forever and, on top of that, knowledgeable.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOpaCoppWherO1wqGgnmWimq6kwNJmopqsqWK9pr7RsmSapZWntqStzWagnaecYrK5tdNmaGtrZW1%2FeX2Qa2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
