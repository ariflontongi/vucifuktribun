We are very grateful for his generosity. We all know that his talent and tenacity are unique in the world. Now, we will have the opportunity to see beyond the lights, the pictures in the magazines, the gold records and to really&nbsp;get to know in depth&nbsp;an exceptional person who has accompanied and will accompany many generations in every corner of the planet.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Iglesias, the father of Enrique Iglesias, started in the youth ranks of Spanish soccer club Real Madrid and “finished his career in law until an accident ended his career” as an elite athlete, Netflix said. “A few years after that, he ended up becoming one of the biggest artists in the history of contemporary music.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the 1970s, Iglesias made a name for himself as a singer in many countries, “but it was in the ’80s when he broke all the records, reached five continents and became the ‘Most Popular Foreign Artist in China’,” the streamer highlighted. In addition to numerous awards, he holds a Guinness World Records trophy as the “Latin artist who has sold the most records in the world.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Iglesias has shared the stage with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Willie Nelson, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, Sting, Dolly Parton, Placido Domingo, Charles Aznavour and Johnny Hallyday, among others.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOp5ytnpyexW621KWgqGWZnLmmv8iaqmarlae2pr%2BMpaCfnV2ovaK6yKyfZquZo7SmvoxqaWxtaGaGdIOUaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
