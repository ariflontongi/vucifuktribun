"It feels like somebody else's existence," she said of the media frenzy surrounding her during the early 2000s. "I can go and visit it and look at it, but it doesn't feel like my life... And not to put it specifically on that one thing, but just the chaos of the entire decade is so far removed from my life now." Miller also admitted the media attention surrounding her and Law's relationship was "scary."</p><p dir=ltr>Miller might not be experiencing the same media frenzy nowadays, but she did use that experience to help her get into character for the series. "It was familiar terrain, because I've experienced some of the things that she experienced. And the feelings were familiar," Miller said, referring to her character Sophie, whose husband is also accused of infidelity. "[But] her way of dealing with what's thrown at her is the absolute antithesis of what my way is." Miller went on to say that there was something "cathartic" about acting out the parallels between her and the character's life.</p><p>Despite the unpleasant memories, Miller still maintains a cordial relationship with Law, even though they've moved on in their lives. "We don't see each other that much," Miller told Porter Magazine in 2016 (via <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>People</a>). "I care about him enormously."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWpjZ4F6e9KinKemkWK6qrjLnqlmp6Cau7R51KlkmpqfqsFuttSdnGakkazAbrzArKtmm5iarrW1zaBkrJuRo7GiuI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
