Photo / AP</p><h3 class=article__subheading--small>KEY POINTS:</h3><p>George Clooney says the "world just got a little less funny" following Bernie Mac's death on Saturday.</p><p>The actor - who starred alongside Mac in 2001 movie <i>Ocean's Eleven</i> and the film's two sequels - revealed he would miss Mac, who died aged 50 of complications arising from pneumonia, in a Chicago hospital.</p><p>Clooney said: "The world just got a little less funny. He will be missed dearly."</p><p>Brad Pitt, who also starred in the crime caper trilogy, added: "I lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man. My thoughts are with Bernie's wife Rhonda and their family. Bernie Mac, you are already missed."</p><p>Samuel L. Jackson, who can be seen in comedy film <i>Soul Men</i> with Mac later this year, said he was "honoured" to have acted alongside the comedian.</p><p>He said: "It goes without saying that Bernie was one of the pre-eminent<br>comedians of our generation. He was also an attentive husband, a great<br>father and loving grandfather. I feel blessed to have shared years of<br>friendship with Bernie Mac, and I'm honoured to have finally co-starred with him in what I consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement.</p><p>"My sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man."</p><p>Mac is survived by Rhonda, his wife of over 30 years and the couple's 30-year-old daughter Je'Niece, who were both present when the actor died.</p><p>Mary Ann Grossett, Mac's sister-in-law, said Rhonda is "devastated" by the loss, adding: "However, she's at peace about his transition because of her faith in God. Her faith is what is sustaining her.</p><p>"They had 30 years of marriage. That's unprecedented in today's time,<br>particularly for celebrities. That brings joy to her. They loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis. She was by his side to the very end."</p><p>Mac's funeral has been scheduled for August 16.</p><p>- BANG!
