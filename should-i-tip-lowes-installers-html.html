Because delivery expenses are seldom, if ever, passed on to drivers, they should not be included in your gratuity calculations. In addition, a minimum delivery price is not the same as a gratuity in most cases.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What percentage do you leave on peloton delivery?</h3><p>I gave a gratuity of around $30. Because of the location of the training room, it was a simple delivery for them, but they arrived an hour early and spent approximately 20 minutes setting it up and guiding me through the Peloton World.
