The Toronto based rapper/singer and the Louisiana legend have given the world several hits such as “Forever,” “HYFR,” “She Will,” to name just three. Other than <a href=# class=text-word rel>Nicki Minaj</a>, Drake and Wayne are the only other exceedingly successful <a href=# class=text-word rel>Young Money</a> artists.</p><p>The lyrical battles between Drake and Wayne exhibit one of the most compelling competitive rivalries ever. In the beginning, or at least, during the&nbsp;So Far Gone days, Wayne and Drizzy sounded suspiciously familiar. It is possible that Drake was so enamored with his idol that he emulated his flow, in the same way that Kobe mimicked Jordan. Once Drake got a foothold in the game though, his sound evolved, as did Wayne’s. The two rappers went from spitting almost identical flows on “Ignorant Shit” and “Ransom,” to branching off in opposite directions creatively as time continued on. In 2014, Drake and Wayne embarked on their “Drake vs. Lil Wayne” tour, which played on Capcom’s Street Fighter series. The tour gave fans a chance to interact with the performances, and vote on which rapper was better. The idea was brilliant, and the interactive app that fans used in real time to decide which rapper won was innovative and user-friendly. Four years later, the debate still rages on. Are Wayne’s energetic and addictive bars, that are wrapped in a raspy drawl, better than Drake’s clever and revealing lyrics, which are packaged in an R&B/hip-hop matrimony?</p><p>We’ve picked out ten essential Drake and Wayne collaborations, and compared the two rap titan’s bars. Drizzy versus Weezy, which rapper would you choose? Cast your vote as you read along.&nbsp;</p><p><br><h2>Ignorant Shit</h2></p><p>Drake Vs Lil Wayne: Who Had The Better Verse?</p><p>Drake’s So Far Gone mixtape propelled the young Canadian actor into superstardom. Having Mixtape Weezy at his side unquestionably elevated the tape from amazing to classic. “Ignorant Shit,” which borrows the instrumental from <a href=# class=text-word rel>Jay-Z</a>'s track of the same name, is a prime example of the unmistakable chemistry between Drizzy and Wayne. Both rappers deliver spirited verses, but Drake’s clever wordplay puts him one step ahead of Wayne on this track.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Winner: Drake</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Favorite Drake Bars:</strong></p><p>“Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over<br>I think better when I'm not sober<br>I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder<br>Private flights back home, no stop-over<br>Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over<br>The shit my mother look shocked over<br>Yeah, but with a canvas, I'm a group of seven<br>A migraine, take two Excedrin<br>I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven.”</p><p><strong>Favorite Lil Wayne Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>I scream, "Fuck the world with a long dick!"<br>Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!<br>You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat<br>Fireman burn down your entire street<br>So fly I'ma take off when I leap<br>Bye! Then you can suck my wings<br>Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming.”</p><p></p><p><h2>Believe Me</h2></p><p>Drake Vs Lil Wayne: Who Had The Better Verse?</p><p>Tha Carter V may never see a release date, but “Believe Me” was able to escape the dungeon in which Baby is storing Wayne’s album. The intended lead single was produced by Boi-1da and Vinylz, and although Drake effortlessly glides through the record, Wayne reminds the world why he’s the boss.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Winner: Lil Wayne</strong></p><p><strong>Favorite Drake Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong><a href=# class=text-word rel>Slim Thug</a> flow but you know I like 'em thick<br>If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip<br>I had to get it poppin' off the rip<br>I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6<br>Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'<br>We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff.”</p><p><strong>Favorite Lil Wayne Bars:</strong></p><p>“When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps<br>I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect<br>It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat<br>One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck<br>Niggas know what that mean like they deaf<br>Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day<br>On the job and the bitch overslept.”</p><p><h2>Right Above It</h2></p><p>Drake Vs Lil Wayne: Who Had The Better Verse?</p><p>I Am Not A Human Being played more like a mixtape than an album, but it is still considered Wayne’s eighth studio album. Although Drake recycled an old verse, the track still attained double platinum status, and still claims the W here with it. Produced by Kane Beatz, “Right Above It” was released while Wayne was in jail, and the New Orleans legend called into <a href=# class=text-word rel>Funkmaster Flex</a> on Hot 97 from Rikers Island to debut the record.</p><p><strong>Winner: Drake</strong></p><p><strong>Favorite Drake Bars:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>My real friends never hearing from me<br>Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me<br>That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused<br>I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews<br>We walk the same path, but got on different shoes<br>Live in the same building, but we got different views<br>I got a couple cars, I never get to use<br>Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos.”</p><p><strong>Favorite Lil Wayne Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building<br>You just on the list of guest names<br>And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games<br>Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change<br>And I smoke 'til I got chest pains<br>And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James<br>Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><h2>HYFR (Hell Ya Fucking Right)</h2></p><p>Drake Vs Lil Wayne: Who Had The Better Verse?</p><p>Take Care had so many singles, it’s sickening. “HYFR” was just one of the many classics off it, with T-Minus handling production and Wayne taking over the chorus. “Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?” Ultimately a dope collaboration all around, but if we had to pick a winner... (it's worth noting that Drake emulates Wayne with his text-and-reply scenario description).</p><p><strong>Winner: Drake</strong></p><p><strong>Favorite Drake Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>She asked what have I learned since getting richer<br>I learned working with the negatives<br>Could make for better pictures<br>I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture<br>Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Favorite Lil Wayne Bars:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>They say love is in the air, so I<br>Hold my breath until my face turn purple<br>Keep a few bad bitches in my circle<br>My nuts hang like ain't no curfew<br>Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you.”</p><p><h2>I'm Goin' In</h2></p><p>Drake Vs Lil Wayne: Who Had The Better Verse?</p><p>“I’m Goin’ In” is another So Far Gone classic. Wayne, Drake, and Jeezy stomp onto this Needlz produced banger like a squad on a mission. Wayne opens with one of the most energetic verses of his esteemed collaboration run, while Drizzy follows up with unforgettable punchlines.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Winner: Lil Wayne</strong></p><p><strong>Favorite Drake Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;“</strong>First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake<br>Making hoes wobble like a bridge in an earthquake<br>Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace<br>I'll give you the business so button up your shirt straight.”</p><p><strong>Favorite Lil Wayne Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle<br>I'm so official all I need is a whistle<br>Bitch named Crystal,&nbsp;let her suck my pistol<br>She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><h2>The Motto</h2></p><p>Drake Vs Lil Wayne: Who Had The Better Verse?</p><p>“The Motto” was the record that introduced the world to YOLO. Drake inadvertently started a worldwide craze with the term, which was inescapable for at least two years. T-Minus handles the production, which is an ode to the Bay Area’s hyphy movement.</p><p><strong>Winner: Drake</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Favorite Drake Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne<br>Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed<br>How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?<br>25, sitting on 25 mill<br>I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself<br>Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay.”</p><p><strong>Favorite Lil Wayne Bars:</strong></p><p>“I'm so Young Money<br>Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny<br>Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar<br>Ain't shit sweet, Niggas on the street like hookers<br>I tongue kiss her other tongue<br>Skeet skeet skeet: water gun.”&nbsp;</p><p><h2>I’m On One</h2></p><p>Drake Vs Lil Wayne: Who Had The Better Verse?</p><p>DJ Khaled gets gifted with some of the best Drake records. Produced by 40, T-Minus, and Kromatik, “I’m On One” electrified the summer of 2011, and became Khaled and Ross’ first top ten single. The chorus on this track may be one of Drizzy’s best, and that’s saying something.</p><p><strong>Winner: Lil Wayne</strong></p><p><strong>Favorite Drake Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>With my skin tanned and my hair long<br>And my fans who been so patient<br>Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation<br>Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit<br>Hate these fucking allegations.”</p><p><strong>Favorite Lil Wayne Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>I walk around the club, fuck everybody<br>And all my niggas got that Heat, I feel like Pat Riley<br>Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money<br>You know the feds listening, nigga what money?<br>I’m a made nigga, I should dust something<br>You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming.”</p><p><h2>No New Friends</h2></p><p>Drake Vs Lil Wayne: Who Had The Better Verse?</p><p>Once again, DJ Khaled is gifted with a Drake and Wayne banger. “No New Friends” was birthed from “Started From The Bottom.” It was originally meant to be a remix before it grew into another song altogether. Boi-1da, 40, Vinylz, and Allen Ritter handle the production, while Drizzy, Wayne, and Ross do what they do best.</p><p><strong>Winner: Drake</strong></p><p><strong>Favorite Drake Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>H-town my second home like I'm James Harden<br>Money counter go *brrrr* when you sellin' out the Garden<br>Four-car garage, pornstar ménage<br>Birdman go *brrrr* 'cause he know this shit retarded<br>Fuck her on the floor 'fore we make it to the bed<br>That's what yo' ass really call started from the bottom.”</p><p><strong>Favorite Lil Wayne Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>They throw dirt on my name<br>Well, that's why they still dig me<br>And I'm tired of all this hatin'<br>I thank God for my patience<br>I thank God for my homies<br>I wish we could trade places<br>Bitch, we good-fellas<br>Boy, all them niggas with you, they just pall bearers.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><h2>Truffle Butter</h2></p><p>Drake Vs Lil Wayne: Who Had The Better Verse?</p><p>Produced by Nineteen86, “Truffle Butter” is about lavish living, not disgusting sexual encounters. The definition of truffle butter was speculated by fans based on an Urban Dictionary post, although neither Nicki, Wayne, nor Drake has verified that post to have any connection to their record. This Nicki Minaj banger samples Maya Jane Coles’ “What They Say.”</p><p><strong>Winner: Lil Wayne</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Favorite Drake Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>New flow, I got a dozen of 'em<br>I don't trust you, you an undercover<br>I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (woo)<br>Talkin' filets with the truffle butter<br>Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it<br>Yeah, they all get what they desire from it<br>What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it.”</p><p><strong>Favorite Lil’ Wayne Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>You ain't gotta tell your friend<br>That I eat it in the morning<br>Cause she gonna say "I know"<br>Can I hit it in the bathroom?<br>Put your hands on the toilet<br>I'll put one leg on the tub<br>Girl, this my new dance move<br>I just don't know what to call it<br>But bitch you dancing with the stars<br>I ain't nothin' like your last dude<br>What's his name? — Not important.”</p><p><h2>Money To Blow</h2></p><p>Drake Vs Lil Wayne: Who Had The Better Verse?</p><p>Somehow “Money To Blow” is a Birdman single, which means Drizzy once again gave away a banger to help assist a comrade. The original featured Drake by himself, but Wayne and Birdman decided to hop on the Drumma Boy produced banger.</p><p><strong>Winner: Drake</strong></p><p><strong>Favorite Drake Bars:</strong></p><p><strong>“</strong>I am on a 24-hour champagne diet<br>Spilling while I'm sipping, I encourage you to try it<br>I'm probably just saying that cause I don't have to buy it<br>The club owner supply it, boy, I'm on that fly shit.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Favorite Lil Wayne Bars:</strong></p><p>“That kush<br>I promise that's my dude<br>But we don't smoke that Reggie Bush<br>And I'm with 2 women<br>Make you take a second look<br>We popping like champagne bottles<br>But we never shook<br>And we gon' be alright if we put Drake on every hook.”&nbsp;</p><p><h2>The Winner</h2></p><p>Drake Vs Lil Wayne: Who Had The Better Verse?</p><p>Now for the grand talley:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Drake</strong>: 6/10</p><p><strong>Lil Wayne:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;4/10</p><p>It seems the student outshined his teacher, at least when it comes to this collection of records.
