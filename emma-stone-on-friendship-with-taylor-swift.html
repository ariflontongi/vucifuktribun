Stone met Swift in 2008 and the two have been friends for 15 years; during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show on Sunday, Stone opened up about the origin story of their connection.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VyNmikFoHYjgGgDagQS6qC-1920-80.jpg><p>“We met at this thing that they had called the Young Hollywood Awards in L.A., and we just kept in touch ever since and became great friends,” Stone said. (Seriously, who is Swift not “great friends” with?)</p><p>Stone told Norton that she attended the opening night performance of the Eras Tour in March 2023 because it took place in her hometown of Glendale, Arizona. And that’s not the only connection she has to the record-breaking world tour: Mandy Moore choreographed both the tour and Stone’s Oscar-winning musical La La Land. “It was incredible to see,” Stone said of the show.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GHrnuLaBYXU4yeuAap7fQR-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ABJ7mHwdg5rgXFPtfPkAfP-1920-80.jpg><p>Norton then asked the actress to confirm the rumor that Swift’s song “When Emma Falls in Love”—a vault track from the singer’s July 2023 album Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)—was about her. “You have to ask her,” Stone said coyly. (“When Emma Falls in Love” is rumored to be about Stone’s relationship with Kieran Culkin, whom she dated from 2010 to 2011,<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/emma-stone-seen-taylor-swift-eras-tour-3-times-8421100 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>People</u></a> reports.)</p><p>Though Swift rarely confirms who she writes specific songs about (unfortunately), the writing seemed pretty well on the wall as she performed the song live as one of her surprise songs during a Kansas City show in July—per<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://ew.com/music/taylor-swift-when-emma-falls-in-love-emma-stone/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>Entertainment Weekly</u></a>, the singer said she’d written it about one of her best friends.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KdRftF4vwC4K6rBf4c7a8T-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mantLrVEXAQaABaep4oTXK-1920-80.jpg><p>This isn’t the first time Stone has opened up about the Eras Tour or her friendship with Swift. In June, she spoke to<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2023/06/emma-stone-is-thankful-taylor-swift-hooked-her-up-with-eras-tour-tickets referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>Vanity Fair</u></a> about it all, saying of the show “The concert was pretty amazing,” and adding “I’ve known [Swift] since we were 17 and 18, so she hooked me up, which was very nice ‘cause I know those tickets are impossible to get.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
