"Doubling as a stylish layering piece and providing extra warmth, shackets offer a casual yet versatile solution for transitional seasons when you need something more substantial than a shirt but not as heavy as a traditional jacket. Or during the colder winter months, layering a shacket under an overcoat."</p><p>Keep scrolling for a greater breakdown on the transitional piece, including more insight from Nelson and tips on how to style a shacket.

"It typically features a button-up front like a shirt, often with a collar, cuffs, and pockets, but is constructed from thicker materials such as flannel or denim, making it the perfect hybrid option for fall," she explains.</p><p>So, even if your initial reaction was along the lines of, "What is a shacket?" it's okay to now shift your mentality to, "Okay, I want one."&nbsp;</p><h2 id=how-to-style-a-shacket-3>How to Style a Shacket</h2><ul><li><strong>Play With Proportions</strong></li></ul><p>"When styling a shacket, I recommend experimenting with proportion play [to] embrace oversized silhouettes paired with more fitted styles," offers Nelson. "For styling clients, I often start with a classic base layer like a plain T-shirt or a simple sweater and layer an oversized shacket on top. Finish the look with straight jeans or trousers and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/best-loafers-for-women/>loafers</a> or <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/best-ballet-flats/>ballet flats</a> for a balanced look."</p><ul><li><strong>Layer, Layer, and More Layers!</strong></li></ul><p>"Have fun layering a textured plaid shacket over a loose cardigan or unbuttoned button-down layered over a simple tee," the stylist says. "Pair with the much-desired <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/best-cargo-pants/>cargo pants</a> this fall season, and you are perfectly on trend and inspiring other fashionistas with your style."</p><ul><li><strong>Experiment With Its Versatility&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>"Because of its versatility, the fresh and fun look of a shacket suits absolutely everyone. The options are endless, whether you want to wear casually with jeans and sneakers or dressed up layered over a fitted <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g34506608/cute-sweater-dresses/>sweater dress</a>," Nelson shares.
