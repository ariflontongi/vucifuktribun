You’ve lost by 77, you’ve been embarrassed, game over halfway through the first quarter.”</p><p>Merrett was far from the only AFL type to receive the honour in recent weeks.</p><p>Rory Sloane was also chaired off following his 250th game against GWS on Saturday night, another game which had ended in a loss for the honouree.</p><p>Cornes also took aim at umpire Brett Rosebury, who was given a guard of honour after officiating his 500th match in this weekend’s clash between Collingwood and Fremantle.</p><p>One of the few who refused the honour was Swans coach John Longmire, who resisted the urging of his side to be chaired off following his 300th match as coach in Sydney’s victory over the Western Bulldogs on Thursday night.</p><p>“There’s a pandemic,” Cornes continued. “We’re now lining up for umpires.<br>“It’s a great effort Brett, you’ve been a terrific umpire, game number 500, but we are lining up too often.</p><p>“What is it? At the end of your career we’ll send you off, you’ll be in the hall of fame, we’ll recognise that.</p><p>“GWS lining up for Rory Sloane in game 250? What is going on?
