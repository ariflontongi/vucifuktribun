It didn't take long for the people close to him to share posts on social media in honor of his memory.</p><p>"Southern Charm" alum Thomas Ravenel wrote on Instagram: "Words can't rightfully describe how rare and remarkable you were. You will be terribly missed by those to whom you were so kind and selfless. My sincerest sympathies to your broken-hearted family." Conner's&nbsp;<a href=#>obituary page</a> is also packed with heart-wrenching messages from friends. "I knew Conner for such a short amount of time, but man, he made a HUGE impact on my life. He was so kind, down to earth and absolutely hilarious," penned Sarah O. "Conner was truly a person who brightened a conversation with his quick wit, and humor. Despite it all. Prayers to his family and close friends. Thank you for the many laughs conner," wrote Alexandra.</p><p>Rest in peace, Conner.
