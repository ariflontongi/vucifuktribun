He made his debut in 1967, in a League Cup match against Blackpool. Corrigan was an understudy to Harry Dowd on City's 1969 FA Cup winner. Corrigan then established himself in the first team during the 1969â€“70 season, and was part of the Manchester City team which won a cup double of the UEFA European Cup Winners Cup and the League Cup. He was also a member of the 1976 League Cup winning side. His debut appearance for <a href=#>England</a> came on 28 May 1976 against Italy, the first of a total of 9 caps, and he was part of the <a href=#>England</a> squad for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. He would undoubtedly have played more time for <a href=#>England</a> if his chances had not been limited by Peter Shilton and Ray Clemence. Corrigan also appeared for Manchester City in the 1981 FA Cup Final defeat by Tottenham Hotspur where he was named as man-of-the match. In total Corrigan made 592 appearances for Manchester City, a figure beaten only by Alan Oakes, and a club record for a goalkeeper. He also won Manchester City's Player of the Year award three times, a feat matched only by Richard Dunne. He is remembered as one of Manchester City's best goalkeepers along with Frank Swift and <a href=#>Bert Trautmann</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeapMZur86rqaKfkaN6r7HTZq6oqqSdenh8mGxt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
