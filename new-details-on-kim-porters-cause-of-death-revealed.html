Her death certificate noted that she was not pregnant at the time of her passing. Her body is reportedly scheduled for burial in Columbus, Ga.</p><p>As previously reported, a call was made on Nov. 15, alleging that Porter, who famously dated music producer Sean "Diddy" Combs on and off for 13 years, was under cardiac arrest. She was soon declared dead. Porter was just 47 years old.</p><p>Considering her young age, there is some mystery surrounding her passing. She was said to have been suffering from flu-like symptoms for some time before her death, but she was reportedly seeking medical treatment. Sources told <a href=#>The Blast</a> that there were no medications found at her home that could cause an accidental overdose.</p><p>The gossip rag noted that Porter's death was initially ruled as "natural" given what investigators had learned from the scene of her passing and interviews with her loved ones.

A source told <a href=#>Radar Online</a> that the event was "heartbreaking." The insider continued, "Everyone was crying so much and everyone feels terrible for the kids. ... They were all seeming in shock but sort of too young to understand what is going on."</p><p>Combs shared three children with Porter, 20-year-old son Christian and 11-year-old twin girls Jessie James and D'Lila. He also helped raise her 27-year-old son, Quincy Brown, from her previous relationship to music producer Al B. Sure (real name Albert Joseph Brown III).</p><p>According to Radar Online, Combs displayed framed photos of Porter around his mansion in Beverly Hills as he hosted a brunch as part of the memorial. A number of famous faces attended to mourn Porter's death and support Combs and his family. Jay Z, Pharrell Williams, Mary J. Blige, Alicia Keys, Rashida Jones, Queen Latifah, and Chris Rock were among guests, as reported by <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a>. French Montana and Kourtney Kardashian were also among the 100 guests at the memorial, as noted by <a href=#>People</a> magazine.

A source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, "Kim's passing has turned his life upside down." Describing Porter as a "ray of sunshine," the insider noted, "She was someone who motivated others to be a better version of themselves."</p><p>And while Porter and Combs "didn't always see eye-to-eye on things," they loved their children and respected one another deeply. "They were on very good terms in recent years. She was a 'ride or die' and very loyal to Diddy," the source said.</p><p>Another source told People that Combs was "very much struggling" and "isn't sleeping."</p><p>Porter and Combs' children have also been greatly affected by her death. Two of their kids have taken to social media to reflect on her passing. Son Quincy <a href=#>shared</a> that he felt "broken," stating that "the only thing that makes sense right now is that you were way too good for this silly world we live in."</p><p>Justin Dior Combs, whom Combs shares with ex Misa Hylton Brim (via <a href=#>AOL</a>), also reacted to Porter's passing online. Posting photos of their family on Instagram, he <a href=#>said</a>, "This can't be real I keep waking up hoping this is all a bad dream.. I just don't understand." He continued, "The other day we were all together dancing & celebrating! My second mother, thank you for loving & accepting me as one of your own I will forever cherish all the special moments and talks we had together please stay close with us and let us hear your voice to guide us."</p><p>Our thoughts remain with Combs and Porter's loved ones during this difficult time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtoan9xe82ermaclamuqrjSZqanZZueum68zqurnqqjYrCiwdKeZKieXZmyosDHZqmerpWWuaawjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
