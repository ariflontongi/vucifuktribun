The problem is that the Australian recording artist never knew she was married and denies Williams is her husband.</p><h4><a href=#>Iggy Azalea initially said no to Ariana Grande collab</a></h4><p>However, Williams claims that he has a common-law marriage with Azalea because the pair “agreed to be married, holding themselves out as man and wife and began residing together in the state of Texas on or about September 2008,” TMZ reported. Williams added that he and Azalea stopped living together last year.</p><p>Apparently, in Texas when a man and a woman live together for a certain length of time they are automatically considered married if they both agree to be married and present themselves as husband and wife to others.</p><h4><a href=#>Best “Fancy” parodies — we thought you knew dat</a></h4><p>But, Azalea’s rep told TMZ that she never agreed to be married or held herself out as Williams’ wife, so there was no marriage.</p><p>As part of his divorce petition, Williams wants the courts to prohibit Azalea from selling assets that they accumulated during their “marriage,” and he wants rights over music she wrote while they were together. Of course, there are millions at stake here.</p><h4><a href=#>Iggy Azalea confesses her love for her man Nick Young</a></h4><p>If the judge decides to recognize the marriage, all the music she made during their union becomes the joint property of the pair, so Williams would be entitled to 50 percent of the profits from it.</p><p>Azalea’s rep says this whole thing is just a ploy on Williams’ part to get some easy cash.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoaWBqgHWDkmigoJ%2BpYq67rcuemKxlmKrAo63NnWSfoZyawG6yzqtknaGmpL%2BksY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
