And yet, it's still remarkable to see just how ripped this kid has already become. In June 2016, <a href=#>TMZ</a> obtained photos of Joseph and Arnold Schwarzenegger at Gold's Gym in Venice, Calif., describing the young man as "jacked like an up-and-coming Mr. Universe." A month later, <a href=#>People</a> spotted father and son riding bikes together. In January 2019, Baena set the internet on fire when he mimicked one of his father's most famous bodybuilding poses and posted the rippling results on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>Speaking of Joseph's dad, he's very confident about his son rising to the top. "He's training very hard ... I'm a big believer in training also for strength," Schwarzenegger told <a href=#>Extra</a>'s Mario Lopez, describing a dead-lift training session the duo shared.&nbsp;"I put it on 455 ... and he did two reps. I saw him do the first one ... [and said], 'Go for the second one, come on, Joseph!' So, he's very serious about it, and I'm very happy about it, because as I said to him, 'It's important to take care of your body, train hard, if you're passionate about that.'"</p><p>Suddenly, that "Diet starts Monday" sign hanging above our desks isn't looking so funny.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcHBhbIFwrdGnpqWcXaiwqcPAq7GeppWctKa%2B0majqK6VYrCptcudZK2nlJbGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
