So I'm very, very privileged to be here."</p><p class=paragraph-text>He then joked: "And she probably wouldn't have been quite as thrilled that I had to take my willie out to get on here!"</p><p class=paragraph-text>George was then incredibly honest about the incident in America which saw him arrested, in a way that would have been very brave on mainstream TV in the late 1990s.</p><p class=paragraph-text>He also opened up about the loss of his mother, and his friendship with Wham! star <a href=#>Andrew Ridgeley</a>.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Talking about Andrew, he said: "Andrew's the smart one. Andrew's off surfing in Cornwall and he's taken a real bashing over the know because I'm still here. Andrew gets the constant drubbing every time his name comes up in association with me he almost uniformly gets slagged off.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"I think over the years that's had quite a negative effect on the way he views the industry, the way he views those days in Wham. But he decided just to get away from it all and went and lived down by the coast. So I don't see much of him."</p><p class=paragraph-text>George also performed his latest single 'Outside', which was inspired by his infamous incident in the States.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The interview is a perfect example of Michael Parkinson's laid back style, yet he was still able to get the best out of his guests. George opens up in a way that is refreshing to see all these years later.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Watch the full interview below:</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/qkqzdAH0tvA/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>George Michael Honest Interview - 1998</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLnOqKuhqpGZtrB6wqikaJmiqba0wNJonp6nopyybrnInJ%2BanZxkuqqvx5qcpWWglr%2Bstc2spqdlmaPBpr7VopywZWFuhnl51aKbnqdf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
