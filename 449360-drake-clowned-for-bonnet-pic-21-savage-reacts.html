Especially "21, can you do something for me" went viral on platforms like TikTok, plus his cheeky "Purr" ad-lib. Recently, 21 responded to a couple of these with streamer Kai Cenat. Meanwhile, there's a recent Drake pic in a bonnet that begs a reaction.</p><p>Drake published an image gallery on Instagram promoting his collaborative album with <a href=# class=text-word rel>21 Savage</a>. Likewise, he gave us the typical sights: a fake gun, drinks, women in hotel rooms. However, the pic that's really taken off captures Drake snuggled up in his bed with a baby blue silk bonnet. Slaughter gang, indeed.</p><p>Surely, Aubrey Graham selfies-turned-memes defined much of his promo this year. Most recently, he got roasted earlier in October for his duck lips. Before that, over the summer, people joked about his <a href=# rel>slicked-back hairstyle.</a> Still, people are thriving in the roast zone and having fun with Drake's socials.</p><p>Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images</p><p>Afterwards, 21 himself reacted to memes of the song <a href=# rel>"Rich Flex"</a> with streamer Kai Cenat. Firstly, he seemed oblivious to the memes Cenat was referencing. Later, though, he caught on to the viral videos and realized they'd appeared on his timeline.</p><p>"Oh, I did see that,"&nbsp;the "Bank Account" rapper said. "That's a trend, though? They tripping, they got Drake f**ked up. Drake gon' slap the f**k out them."</p><p>While Drake didn't respond to those exchanges, he did hop on a call for a classic bet. Specifically, streamer Cenat and 21 were playing 2K, and Drake bet $121k on his partner.</p><p>“I’ma put up $121,000 on my brother,” Drake said after asking which teams they were playing as.</p><p>If that wasn't enough to pressure Kai, 21's confidence added to that challenge. “I’m tryna see who he gon’ play with, I’m basing my s**t off his s**t. If he play with a regular team, I’ll beat his a** with Toronto,” 21 said.</p><p>Amy Sussman/Getty Images</p><p>Like many of us would be, Kai Cenat was blown away by Drake’s six-figure gamble. “$121,000, Drake?! F**k you mean, $121,000?!” he exclaimed. Moreover, he stuttered, jumped up in his chair, and had the Slaughter Gang head giggling.</p><p>“If you win, I’ll pay you $121k,” Drake said, “but if 21 wins, then me and you have to do something for the kids. We gotta go and just give back somehow.”</p><p>“Let’s do it!” Cenat supported enthusiastically.</p><p>Regardless, stay tuned to HotNewHipHop for the latest on Drake and 21's continued buzz off of their album Her Loss.
