Miranda, who was portrayed as a strict, hard-to-please boss, is seen as being far more vulnerable in the new footage, which completely changes the film's direction. &nbsp;</p><p id=enN0SpsgAe0r data-wc=43>The clip was shared on Twitter by Buzzfeed writer Spender Althouse, and takes place during the black tie gala held by Runway. The scene shows <a class=hm-link href=#>Anne Hathaway's</a> character, Andy, helping to smooth over an awkward situation between Miranda's drunk husband and her boss, Irv Ravitz. &nbsp;</p><p id=eM3QQ_XCk5lR data-wc=24>I'm just seeing this deleted scene from The Devil Wears Prada for the first time, and honestly it changed the whole movie for me <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/6Zkr6UxHQO</a></p>— Spencer Althouse (@SpencerAlthouse) <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>August 28, 2017</a><p style=text-align:center id=ePF25SWSEdXR data-wc=11><strong>The deleted scene that changes everything in The Devil Wears Prada&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ecfw2k3yFxm4 data-wc=43>The footage shows the two men exchanging words, before Andy breaks up the tension by asking Irv about publishing. Soon after, Miranda is seen mouthing 'thank you' to Andy, which leaves her – and fans of the 2006 movie – in utter shock. &nbsp;</p><p id=ehH7duRF3XPB data-wc=106>Spencer posted the deleted scene on social media, captioning it: "&nbsp;I'm just seeing this deleted scene from for the first time, and honestly it changed the whole movie for me." Fans were quick to give their own opinions on what they thought of it, with many thinking it would have ruined the film. "I'm glad they took it out, it doesn’t belong," one wrote, while another said: "Thank you doesn’t not exist in Miranda Priestly's vocabulary. A third added: "Makes Miranda vulnerable (to stupid hubby) which is not her persona. So I c&nbsp;y&nbsp;they left it out (sic)" said another. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/37dd7831c0c9-miranda-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eKloPbU1_HW4 data-wc=19><strong>Miranda Preistly came across in a very different light - mouthing thank you to Andy in new unearthed scene</strong></p><p id=et4QvOzLl7yg data-wc=26>Others, however, were in favour of the scene. "Why wasn’t this in the movie," one asked. Another fan said: "Omg!

The one similarity is that Andy does still save the day, but this time by helping colleague Emily, who forgets a name of a guest.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
