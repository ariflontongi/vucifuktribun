Okay, there we go. There’s some friendly banter going on out there as there always is between NSW and Queensland,” the commentator on Fox Sports said.</p><p>The youngster addressed the incident after the day’s play, saying adrenaline got the better of him and he’d apologise to McDermott.</p><p>“A bit of adrenaline kicked in. I got pumped the ball before so I was pretty keen on getting a wicket with the next one,” Nisbet said.</p><p>“I feel I have to (show some aggression). If I want to bowl well I have to get into a bit of a contest. I didn’t say anything (to McDermott) but I’ll apologise to him later. I probably shouldn’t be doing that in my first game but you live and you learn.”</p><p>McDermott ultimately had the last laugh thanks to an unbelievable record 73-run final-wicket partnership between Queensland bowlers Kane Richardson and Gurinder Sandhu denied NSW what seemed a certain victory for the second time in three days in their one-day clash at North Sydney Oval.</p><p>NSW had managed just 217 from less than 45 overs batting first thanks to a stirring 82 from captain Moises Henriques and 59 from opener Damel Hughes.</p><p>That total looked more than enough when Queensland slumped to 9-146, victory hopes looking dashed for the Bulls before the brilliant and unexpected last wicket stand as Richardson finished the match with a massive six off Ben Dwarshuis, one of two the fast bowler hit.</p><p>Richardson struck an equal career-best 36 off just 34 balls and Sandhu finished unbeaten on 46, to go with the two-wickets he took with the ball in a man-of-the-match performance.</p><p>It was the highest-ever 10th wicket stand in the Australian domestic one-day competition.</p><p>“It was awesome … how was that last shot, over cover for six, bets shot of the season maybe,” Sandhu said after the win.</p><p>“We were just working together, I had full trust in Kane, he had full trust in me and everyone on the sidelines had full trust in everyone.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“We were just talking every over, trying to get each other through to the next one, then the next one.</p><p>“Each over was changing, we were trying to be aggressive ... we needed to score to win.”</p><p>It was Queensland’s first one-day win of the summer and piled on more misery for NSW who went winless in the Shield season for the first tie ever last season, and also managed just two one-day wins.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ70qmmq6xfmL%2Bqr8qeq2imo6x6urvUp56srJWnerOtyKycrGWVrrKjvs6wqmavmam1bsHGpbBmq5WjsbCyxWaYnKxdnrtuucCrqqFlk6q9cLrEsKpmq6Skv7p7knKcnmyTmYKmg5NxbJtukpuFenyPbmtycZWYgKKEj5o%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
