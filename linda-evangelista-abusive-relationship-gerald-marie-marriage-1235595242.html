I understand that concept because I lived it. If it was a matter of just saying, ‘I want a divorce, see ya,’ it doesn’t work that way.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Evangelista suggests that this man was physically violent, saying, as it sounds like her voice is breaking, “He knew not to touch my face, not to touch the moneymaker, you know?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She adds, “I married him when I was 22 and I got out when I was 27, and he let me out as long as he got everything. But I was safe and I got my freedom.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In response to Evangelista’s claims, Marie’s lawyer Céline Bekerman said in a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter that her client “firmly objects to the defamatory and false allegations made against him. He refuses to participate in this dishonest media controversy.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In 2021, Marie was <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>accused of various acts of alleged sexual assault</a> in the 1980s and 1990s by 15 women. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>French prosecutors in 2023</a> closed their investigation into the allegations, saying they exceeded the country’s statute of limitations.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">At the time, Evangelista said she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">believed the women</a> who accused Marie of misconduct.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Hearing them now, and based on my own experiences, I believe that they are telling the truth,” she said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">And when the charges were dropped, Marie’s attorney said, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>in a statement obtained by Agence France-Presse</a>, that he “welcomed the closing of this case. The justice system has finally triumphed despite the outrageous media campaign that Gérald Marie has suffered for two years. With this decision, it is now established that Gérald Marie is and will remain innocent.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In <a href=# id=auto-tag_the-super-models_1 data-tag=the-super-models>The Super Models</a>, Evangelista reflects on those allegations.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“When I found out that he’s hurt many, many, many women, he’s violated many women,” she says as she appears to be on the verge of tears, “it broke my heart…. I never told my story because I feared,” she says, trailing off. “Thanks to the power of all these women coming forward — bless them, God bless all of them — it gave me the courage now to speak.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She adds, “I would love that justice be served. I would love for assholes like that to think twice and be afraid. And I would love women to know that they’re not alone.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the docuseries, as part of a title card noting the French investigation being closed due to the statute of limitations, the card adds that Marie’s lawyer says, “He denies claims of abuse and adds that he ‘has never committed the slightest act of violence.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofK21zZ2YZp2mlruoscuiqq2ZXZavtr%2FIr5xmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYrSmvsClm2alkae2pnnMmqmroZGcsm59kWxsbnFlZ4Fzew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
