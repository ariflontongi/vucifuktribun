That’s lunch sorted for a couple of days.”</p><p>Plenty of members of the group who are well versed in the art of sniffing out a deal were surprised by the policy.</p><p>“I didn’t know about this?!” said one Facebook user.</p><p>“Learn something new everyday,” said another.</p><p>Meanwhile, plenty were aware of the deal and said they kept an eye on the number of hot chooks in the cabinet.</p><p>“I check every time I’m there, if there’s no chicken I get a voucher even if I wasn’t going to buy one,” one member of the group said.</p><p>“They (Coles) ask if you can wait, but you say no and they give a voucher,” another recommended. “I also run around the shop telling everyone to go score a free chook.”</p><p>There has, however, been some confusion about which stores offer the deal, if it’s available in Queensland and if it depends on an empty cabinet.</p><p>But a Coles spokeswoman said the policy, which was relaunched in March, was in place at every store across Australia.</p><p>“We know customers love to get their hands on our delicious hot roast chickens, so for customers who aren’t able to purchase one at the time they want within the period specified in-store, we can provide them with a voucher for a free hot roast chicken,” she said.</p><p><i>Continue the conversation on Twitter <a class=body-link href=#>@James_P_Hall</a> or <a class=body-link href=#>james.hall1@news.com.au</a></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2S%2FpsDAoqNom5%2BhsrR50Z6toq6VqHqnvsSeZKGnpGKwqbvOpGSpp5yesLp5x6iuZqyfYruiroyaZJ%2BqlZp6s7vArKtmm5iesKyxzWilnq%2BjYsC1u9GyZp1okmaydLLBnZlqmpWaf3WtxGubnWiUbn%2BkgJWbbWxx</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
