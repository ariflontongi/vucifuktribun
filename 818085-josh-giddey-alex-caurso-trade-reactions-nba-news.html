Overall, the NBA star was accused of having <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sex with an underage girl</a>. Eventually, the league and law enforcement agencies stepped in to investigate. Subsequently, both investigations came to an end, and Giddey was cleared. However, his reputation took a massive hit, and he cannot escape the jokes that fans are constantly making at his expense.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It had become clear that his days in Oklahoma City were numbered. A trade was imminent, and it took place on Thursday. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, Giddey was sent to the Chicago Bulls for Alex Caruso. There were no draft picks involved, making this a one-for-one trade. However, there was a massive controversy behind this trade as many felt like the Thunder completely fleeced the Bulls. After all, Caruso is a defensive monster with a championship pedigree.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-josh-giddey-for-alex-caruso>Josh Giddey For Alex Caruso</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In many of the tweets below, fans were adamant that this trade was absolutely egregious. In fact, some said that this just proves the Bulls are one of the worst organizations in sports right now. At this stage, the team is a bit directionless. Overall, the recent trade just goes to prove that they are asleep at the wheel, and not all that interested in winning. Hopefully, they are able to do something else in the offseason to build trust with their fanbase.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bulls-get-destroyed>Bulls Get Destroyed</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of the trade between the Chicago Bulls and the Oklahoma City Thunder, in the comments section down below.
