Watching it was a little like watching actual footage of World War II, if the Nazis were zombies and everyone had dragons. It was just a near constant bloodbath, with beloved characters dying and/or almost dying for almost 90 minutes straight.</p><p>By the end of the episode, honestly, things were looking bleak. The body count was already significant and the characters who were still alive were all pretty much moments away from death.

Here's what you need to know about how Arya connects to the Westerosi legend.</p><p>Azor Ahai was a legendary hero who fought against the darkness using a magical sword called Lightbringer. He's revered by followers of the Lord of Light, the most prominent of whom in the series is Melisandre, aka the Red Woman. While Azor Ahai is a legend from Essos, his story lines up nicely with a legend from Westeros about the "last hero," who saved the world from darkness during the Long Night. Since this episode was called "The Long Night"&nbsp;and&nbsp;featured a lot of Melisandre,&nbsp;it seems fair to assume they're related.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><p>Followers of the Lord of Light believe in a figure known as The Prince That Was Promised, who is basically the reincarnation of Azor Ahai, and destined to save mankind from the darkness in its second coming—which, sure seems to have been the White Walkers and the Army of the Dead.</p><p>Since Arya killed the Night King and vanquished the darkness, that does seem to make her our Prince (Princess—since the word for "prince" in high Valyrian is gender neutral) That Was Promised. What's more, Melisandre, who has been, by&nbsp;far&nbsp;our greatest link to the Lord of Light and the prophecy of the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/news/a28973/game-of-thrones-jon-snow-night-king/>Prince That Was Promised</a>, made it pretty clear that Arya was the chosen one in several important moments from the episode.</p><p>First, before the Battle of Winterfell really kicks off and just after Melisandre arrives back at the castle, she shares a very long, lingering, laden-with-meaning look with Arya.</p><p>Then, after Arya shows off some of her badass Faceless Men fighting skills, she's saved by Lord Beric Dondarrion—the eyepatch-wearing, flaming sword-wielding man who the Lord of Light has brought back from the dead a whopping 19 times (according to The Hound) to fulfill his true purpose. That purpose, it turns out, was saving Arya, because he dies in the process and Melisandre all but confirms that Arya is Prince-That-Was-Promised levels of important before echoing the words of her old fencing instructor, Syrio Forel: "What do we say to the God of Death?" To which Arya replies, "Not today," before running off to do something important.</p><p>Unlike Azor Ahai, Arya doesn't use a flaming sword or one forged by driving it through the heart of her one true love. Instead, she&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a27293003/game-of-thrones-fan-theory-dead-starks-battle-of-winterfell/>kills the Night King</a>&nbsp;with good old Valyrian steel—the dagger that was used by the assassin who attempted to kill Bran in Season 1.

Things look bad for a second when the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a27190572/night-king-theory-game-of-thrones/>Night King</a>&nbsp;grabs Arya by the throat and blocks her attack, but she effortlessly drops the dagger into her other hand and stabs him, causing him to shatter into a pile of ice and putting an end to the White Walkers and the undead as well.</p><p>This has been the plan for a while now, as the creators revealed in the post-episode recap.</p><p>"For three years, we’ve known it was going to be Arya to deliver that fatal blow," creator David Benioff said. "We hope to avoid the expected. Jon Snow is a savior...but it just didn’t feel right for us in this moment. We knew it had to be Valyrian steel to the exact spot where the Child of the Forest put the dragonglass blade to create the Night King. And he’s uncreated by the Valyrian steel."</p><p>This article has been updated to cite The Hound's reference to Beric dying.</p><p>For more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the&nbsp;Marie Claire&nbsp;newsletter.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://link.marieclaire.com/join/3oa/mar-newsletter?authId=F0CC0C27-80DA-4734-ABDF-E4115B84A56B&maj=WNL&min=ARTICLES" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>SUBSCRIBE HERE</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomGtvY2V9cYOPaJirsZFirru70WaYoZmZYrSiucRmpp9lpJ2%2FsLrErGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
