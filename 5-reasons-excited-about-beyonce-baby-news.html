Why wouldn't they be? Many have been waiting for the artist and her husband, <a class=hm-link href=#>Jay Z</a>, to announce they were expanding their family for years -- <a class=hm-link href=#>Blue Ivy</a>, 5, pretty darn cute.</p><p id=eG9FA9DwQlMU data-wc=26>But there are several other reasons we at are delighted by her surprise Instagram announcement. Here are five reasons we're absolutely pumped about this pregnancy.</p><p id=eFC_Xu_Xj0x8></p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eperPf6hMesA data-wc=3><strong>The maternity fashion</strong></p><p id=e0gtLbp6fyt2 data-wc=80>Beyoncé has always been a master at dressing -- and that includes the style statements she made while she was pregnant with Blue Ivy. She rocked high heels, beautiful gowns and immaculate suits with such gusto that women everywhere, whether they were expecting or not, began watching "what she'd wear next." Even the way she announced this pregnancy was on point and sartorially smart (Agent Provocateur lingerie, anyone?). We honestly can't wait to see what she wears to the <a class=hm-link href=#>Grammys</a>!</p><p id=e9l9BJyWda04 data-wc=6><strong>The musical inspiration this will provide</strong></p><p id=eAVMj_TFvThl data-wc=65>Beyoncé has always used her real-life experiences as inspiration for her songs and albums. is just one example. Another is the music video, which featured Blue Ivy smiling and dancing in a white dress. Welcoming twins into the world will no doubt provide her with some excellent fodder for new projects. Maybe she'll even feature the new babes on whatever tracks she writes!</p><p id=eOLOyQ_eXv75 data-wc=7><strong>Watching Blue Ivy become a big sister</strong></p><p id=e16rjDurYMy9 data-wc=64>The curly-haired beauty is basically the big sister we all wished we had. Just think of all the things she'll be able to teach her two siblings: posing for the camera, walking a red carpet, overcoming travel-related fatigue, paling around with other celebrities... we could go on. It's also safe to assume that she has some pretty awesome hand-me-downs to share with the twins.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=er27-c8rV7gr data-wc=7><strong>Two more people will inherit Beyoncé's genes</strong></p><p id=e-lIak6xOWre data-wc=136>The 35-year-old is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful women in the world -- and even if her twins inherit a small shred of her genes, they will be lucky. Same goes for her positive attitude. Beyoncé has made it her goal to challenge conventional beauty standards and a woman’s role in society. "It’s really about changing the conversation," she once told . "It’s not about perfection. It’s about purpose. We have to care about our bodies and what we put in them. Women have to take the time to focus on our mental health—take time for self, for the spiritual, without feeling guilty or selfish. The world will see you the way you see you, and treat you the way you treat yourself." The world is a better place with her in it.</p><p id=eRTHN5FBbUv9 data-wc=8><strong>2016 was a rough year in pop culture</strong></p><p id=eYaWjP61h5wg data-wc=38>The world needed this blast of good news. 2016 was full of celebrity breakups and the untimely deaths of many a musician and actor. We can only hope this news is a sign that the sad-stories-tide is turning.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
