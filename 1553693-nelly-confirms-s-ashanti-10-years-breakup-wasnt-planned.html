One of these reasons is maturity. Truth is, many relationships ended many years ago not because both parties did not love each other. But because they were not mature enough to handle the challenges of that relationship."When couples are not mature, they stifle life out of their relationship.Love is not enough. It takes two mature couples to remain in love. Many relationships you see today have died not because both parties are not in love, but because they aren’t mature to remain in love. It takes maturity to handle the differences in a relationship."And sometimes, this maturity comes with age. As you grow, you unlearn & learn new things about love and relationships. So, when two people decide to come back after many years, at the root of it is GROWTH and MATURITY. So, if a couple split 10 years ago and they decide to come back after 10 years, it means they’ve grown to know that they can make it work. They are now mature to handle situations better.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/771bf88a9d248d37.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"Cabal in gospel music industry": Woli Arole encourages singers to speak up after Mohbad's death</span></p></a>"When two couples reconcile after many years, it means they are willing to make it work. Age and Maturity changes how you do relationships.
