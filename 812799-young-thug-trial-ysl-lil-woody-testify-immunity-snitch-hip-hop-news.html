Moreover, YSL Lil Woody recently spoke to Judge Ural Glanville in the courtroom, and the judge told him that the court granted him immunity and thus expects him to testify. If Woody doesn't testify, then Glanville clarified that he would hold him in contempt and subject him to jail time, and by the end of the exchange, Woody seemingly agreed to testify. It's also important to note that he was explicitly informed that prosecutors could not use his testimony against him.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, this is far from the only controversy surrounding cooperation that YSL Lil Woody has faced concerning the Young Thug and YSL trial. In fact, he even has something relating to the collective's feud with YFN Lucci and that crew, as a video leaked last year of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">an interrogation that investigators conducted with Woody</a>. This even led to a mistrial request, but that didn't lead to much other than folks debating and discussing this development. Since then, his name didn't come up much in court proceedings, but we'll see whether this testimony is any different.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ysl-lil-woody-considers-testifying-in-young-thug-trial-watch>YSL Lil Woody Considers Testifying In Young Thug Trial: Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, this comes amid a strangely light time in the Young Thug and YSL trial, at least when it comes to the headlines and narratives currently surrounding it. For example, the courtroom couldn't help but <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">break out in laughter</a> as a witness called Thugger's "Lifestyle" with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rich Homie Quan</a> and others a "banger." Out of everything said during this harrowing and frustratingly long legal process, that might be the most true thing to come out of a participant's mouth. Jokes aside, it's at least been heartening to see Jeffery and others balance out the hardship with a smile, hard work, appreciative messages, or other shows of perseverance.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Still, folks continue to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">advocate for Young Thug and YSL's freedom</a> on their behalf, a possibility we seem no closer to witnessing. No matter what happens next in this court case, it's clear that there will be a lot of left-over conversation surrounding cooperation and testimonies. After all, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Gunna</a> already caused a storm with his decision, one that still has repercussions and implications for his career today. We'll see if this discourse evolves any more than it already has.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.

Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output.

As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
