He always knows how to bring tons of energy to any track. Soon, we are going to be getting another full project from him to enjoy. In fact, it will be just a few more weeks until that time comes. Busta <a href=# rel>announced his 11th full-length studio release</a>, BLOCKBUSTA on his Instagram a few weeks ago. "IT'S TIME!! 11.24.23 #BLOCKBUSTA&nbsp;ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø ALBUM ARTWORK CURATED BY&nbsp;@mikeamiri<br>ALBUM EXECUTIVE PRODUCED BY&nbsp;THE üêâ x&nbsp;@therealswizzz&nbsp;x&nbsp;@pharrell&nbsp;x&nbsp;@timbaland."</p><p>It certainly looks to be a blockbuster of a project, especially with three of the best producers the genre has ever seen. Additionally, we already have some knowledge of guest artists as well. Busta has put out two singles ahead of the LP. The lead cut brought on BIA for "BEACH BALL." Then, we got "LUXURY LFE" with another up-and-coming female rap star, Coi Leray. Now, <a href=# rel>the New York legend </a>is getting to team up with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Young Thug</a>.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Rick Ross ‚ÄúDoubts‚Äù 50 Cent Beef Is Squashable: ‚ÄúEverything [He] Does Sucks‚Äù</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-busta-rhymes-new-track-will-be-called-ok>Busta Rhymes' New Track Will Be Called "Ok"</h2></span><p>According to Uproxx, the song will be titled "Ok," and it will be coming on Friday, November 10. This comes from Busta himself with a short Instagram video. On top of hyping the album once again, he included the details about his work with Thugger. "NEW SINGLE&nbsp;#OK&nbsp;FT.&nbsp;@thuggerthugger1&nbsp;DROPPING 11.10.23!!" This will be the first song they are on together. It should be an entertaining cut from start to finish.</p><p>What are your initial thoughts on this upcoming single, "Ok," with Busta Rhymes and Young Thug?
