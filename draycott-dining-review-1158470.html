Rare, however, is the newcomer fortunate to find itself overrun from night one with patrons eager to join those ranks. That’s the reality of the Draycott, an all-day British-inflected brasserie that bowed in late September as the high-gloss signature <a href=# id=auto-tag_dining data-tag=dining>dining</a> establishment of&nbsp;Rick Caruso’s new redevelopment, Palisades Village. (Caruso is the maestro of refined schmaltz also behind the comparatively down-market The Grove.)</p><p>The chatter among the predominantly local crowd is evidence of a clubhouse being born in real time: “I’ve been in four times this week.” “You’ve got to get the manager’s card.” Most importantly: “I’m making this my table.”</p><p>The married couple behind the Draycott is&nbsp;Matt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Marissa Hermer, recent arrivals from England (though she was raised in Orange County). She was on Bravo’s&nbsp;Ladies of London; he made his name creating the royals-luring club Boujis; they collaborated on a pair of fancified country-fare spots there called Bumpkin. Their aesthetic here is mostly a brazen swipe from Cecconi’s in West Hollywood — bright furniture, marble bar, showpiece terrace, a generalized air of Europe-on-holiday. It’s all leavened with kids books and board games in a converted martini trolley.</p><p>Hand it to the Hermers: They’ve anticipated the conservative taste of their demo, constructing a streamlined menu strategic in its lack of edge. Visitors won’t be challenged by, say, offal, or any other British gastronomic adventurism. Even the curry spice in a roasted cauliflower starter — a nod to England’s proud heritage of Indian cuisine — is restrained to a near-comic blandness.</p><p>The Draycott’s sweet spot is the tried-and-true, whether squarely Anglo or traditionally Hollywood. There’s a stellar fish and chips, a juicy pork chop paired with an excellent slaw, and a casually flawless Pimm’s Cup. Meanwhile, at lunch, the chop salad — which includes chicory, fagioli beans and flecks of Parmigiano-Reggiano — could convert disciples of the iconic iteration at La Scala.</p><p>Yet the triumphs (like a buttery, pan-roasted trout) are undermined by some real misses: a bowl of moules-frites in a wincingly acidic broth; chicken liver mousse that repeatedly arrived out-of-the-fridge stiff and astonishingly flavorless. Luckily, the amiable servers are rapid-response specialists who, like the Hermers, appear hypercognizant of the reality that their patrons are the types not only to return a disappointing dish but also to relish spending the next week telling everyone they know about it. And at the Draycott, that could mean half the Palisades.</p><p>15255 Palisades Village Lane; (310) 573-8938<br><strong>Recommended:</strong> Draycott chop ($18), pan-roasted trout ($28), pork chop ($29)<br><strong>Best table:</strong> Two booths with views of the bar and terrace</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>This review is based on multiple visits.
