The couple have had a lifelong friendship, as Sarah, born to aristocratic ancestry as the daughter of Major Ronald Ferguson and his first wife Susan Barrantes, first met Prince Andrew when they were childhood playmates. In 1985, however, the two became reacquainted at a Royal Ascot party, leading the onetime pals to fall in love. Prince Andrew popped the question with a Burmese ruby ring from Garrard, the choice of gem inspired by the future bride's red hair. The couple announced their engagement in March 1986, posing for this photo in the grounds of Buckingham Palace.Five years after Andrew's brother Prince Charles married Princess Diana, flag-waving crowds once again flooded the streets of London as Sarah and Andrew married in spectacular style at Westminster Abbey on July 23, 1986.Scroll through to see the best photos of Andrew and Sarah's royal wedding day.Photo: Tim Graham/Getty Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a973ad9a559f-gallery35-a.jpg> For her big day, Sarah wore an embroidered ivory silk gown by British couturier Lindka Cierach. The bride's 17ft train was emblazoned with the letter 'A', as well as her personal coat of arms.
