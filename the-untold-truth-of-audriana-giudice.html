It all started when Teresa Giudice began her 15-month prison sentence (she ended up serving 11 months) in January 2015 for bankruptcy and mail fraud, which was followed up by Joe Giudice's 41-month prison term in March 2016, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. <a href=#>Joe was deported</a> back to his native country, Italy, upon his release in 2019, as he never became an American citizen.</p><p>As if that weren't tragic enough, during an episode of&nbsp;Real Housewives of New Jersey, Audriana came to the heartbreaking realization that she has very few memories of her father before he went to prison. While sifting through family photos, Audriana's oldest sister, Gia Giudice, asked her if the snaps helped jog her memory about happier times with their father. "Probably not," Gabriella Giudice commented as Audriana appeared to hold back tears, as seen in a clip shared via&nbsp;<a href=#>The Daily Dish</a>.</p><p>Later in a talking head interview, Gia opened up about how difficult it was to realize Audriana doesn't remember any of the good times. "It's very hard watching Audriana not remember any of these moments because I have so many memories that I could think of with my father, and she has very few."&nbsp;We're&nbsp;not crying.&nbsp;You're&nbsp;crying.</p><p>The good news in all of this? Audriana has since&nbsp;<a href=#>enjoyed family visits in Italy with Joe</a>, and now she has new memories to remember.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2tlZ4Fze9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5wK6bq6GRo65us8ium6KblWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
