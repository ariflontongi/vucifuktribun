The money was to be used for Lex's medical bills, which is why Meester was "disgusted" when she found out her mom was using the payments for other purposes, according to an insider who spoke to <a href=#>Radar Online</a>.</p><p>In the 2011 lawsuit against her mom, Meester also asked for custody of Lex. A source told Radar Online, "She wants Lex to leave their mom's California home and come to live with her in New York... Leighton is really close to her brother, so she just hates that she can't be there to help him more."</p><p>The terms of the custody battle were not revealed, but in 2014, it was clear that Lex had remained in his mom's custody. Constance told <a href=#>InTouch</a> that after Meester cut her off financially, her home went into default, she couldn't afford to buy food, and she and Lex began searching for homeless shelters. "I only have $26 left. If something doesn't happen soon, we'll be homeless by the holidays," Constance told the magazine. Meester's mom also said doctors were "pretty sure" she had lymphoma.</p><p>We hate to see families battling, so we can only hope Meester and her mom will eventually establish a peaceful relationship and Lex will receive the care he needs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhia4Fze8ueoKCgpKS7brnEnqqtnaKoerW%2BwKCgnGWimq6tecuinZ5lo6m8s8WO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
