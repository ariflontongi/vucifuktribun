White sand beaches and volcanic scenery make it a popular holiday destination It’s wild and beautiful in a barren, epic way and cruise ship passengers can easily enjoy its bountiful charms once they break free of the fairly dull capital city.</p><h3>Cruise port location</h3><p>Cruise ships dock at the main port of Puerto del Rosario, which handily sits right in front of the centre of this unassuming Canarian city.</p><h3>Can I walk to any places of interest?</h3><p>There are two answers to that. One is yes – you can walk to all points in the city as the port is very central. The other answer is no as there is little of real interest in the least beguiling of the Canarian capitals.&nbsp;</p><h3>Getting around</h3><p>You can walk anywhere in Puerto del Rosario. We advise making a beeline for the main bus station, 20 minutes away. A network of fast and efficient buses snake around the island, though as there is so much to see and do rather than one or two major attractions, a hire car or excursion is the best option.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to see and do&nbsp;</h3><p>The new street art and sculptures cannot disguise how little there is to do in Puerto del Rosario. Culture vultures could try the modest Casa Museo Unamuno or the Centro de Arte Juan Ismael (30 Calle Almte. Lallemand). You are much better off taking a bus, hire car or excursions out of town to discover an island that is much more than just a beach holiday destination.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Parque Natural do Corralejo</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: istock</span></figure><h3>What can I do in four hours or less?</h3><p>If you are a city slicker desperate to tick off another city from your global list you can easily stroll around Puerto del Rosario. There are a sprinkling of local cafes to relax in, but restaurants are not the city’s strongest suit. If you are a beach lover catch the bus or a taxi up to Parque Natural do Corralejo to savour mile upon mile of pristine white sand blown in from the Sahara. If you’ve a hire car (book in advance) stop off here to enjoy the binary colours of azure blue ocean and starched white sand, before taking a stroll through the charming resort of Corralejo. You can enjoy lunch here by the waterfront gazing out towards the neighbouring island of Lanzarote.</p><p>Time permitting, stop for coffee and cake in the small village of Lajares, where the ex-pat surf community have set up a sprinkling of great cafes. Costa Cruises offers a four-hour excursion to the village of Betancuria, the capital of Fuerteventura until 1834. It’s a real oasis in the desert landscape with a decent museum and charming historic streets to explore. The bus ride there and back introduces you to the stark local landscapes too.</p><h3>What can I do in eight hours or less?&nbsp;</h3><p>For a longer driving trip you could cover the above northern route, but then enjoy a delicious boat fresh seafood lunch in the fishing village of El Cotillo (see below). From there push south by the mysterious ancient mountain of Tindaya in search of Betancuria. As an inland town it has a totally different ambience to the popular coastal resorts and offers a window into the island’s colonial history. Part of the attraction of Fuerteventura are its epic skies and wide open volcano dotted spaces, which you can really appreciate on this day driving.</p><p>P&O Cruises ‘Catamaran Cruise to Lobos Island’ meanwhile takes you up by the famous dunes and beaches of Corralejo, where you board a catamaran for the short sail across to the uninhabited volcanic islet of Los Lobos. There is time to check out its network of walking trails before you sail on to a secluded bay for a buffet lunch aboard. Note P&O also offer a simple bus transfer service to Corralejo that allows around three hours in this charming resort town. There are plenty of cafes to relax in, a swathe of shopping opportunities and a sprinkling of decent restaurants, many overlooking the ocean.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Betancuria is a charming inland village to visit</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: istock</span></figure><h3>Eat and drink</h3><p>Seafood is the highlight with the fishing village of El Cotillo worth the trip up there to dine for alone. A huddle of superb restaurants lie sprinkled around the picturesque old harbour. Pick of the bunch is one of the best seafood restaurants in the Canaries – <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>La Vaca Azul</a>.</p><p>Don’t miss the island’s renowned goat’s cheese, which has won special accreditation from the European Union.</p><h3>Don’t leave the island without…</h3><p>Puerto del Rosario is not a great city for shopping, but the sales tax here is lower than in mainland Spain so it offers reasonable value. The epicentre of the city’s retail action is the Las Rotondas mall. Around 100 outlets lie dotted around the sprawling mall. For those travelling with kids there is a playground.</p><h3>Need to know</h3><h4>Flight time</h4><p>Ryanair and easyJet fly direct to Fuerteventura from London with a flight time of around four hours.</p><h4>Safety&nbsp;</h4><p>Most visits are trouble free and crime is low in Puerto del Rosario. You should still be vigilant in crowded places for pickpockets.&nbsp;</p><h4>Best time to go</h4><p>This is the land of eternal spring where there is no bad time to visit. Saying that the biggest crowds descend in European summer and around Christmas, so if you want a more relaxed experience visit outwith these peak periods. Note that it can be windy here at any time of year.</p><h4>Closures&nbsp;</h4><p>Shops tend to open at around 9am and then close at either 5pm or 6pm, though many more traditional businesses still observe the afternoon siesta (between around 2pm and 5pm), then stay open later. Malls tend to keep longer hours, while many businesses tend to operate reduced hours or close on Sundays.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6cqa6ho5rAcLzOq6tmn6Wesaa%2FjqmsnqqkpHqlsctmqairkae2sHnFrpyrrJWrsq%2FA1KuYZpuiqra0sYyppqusXZzCqrDEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
