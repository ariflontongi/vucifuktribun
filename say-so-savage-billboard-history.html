Yesterday, rappers Doja Cat and Nicki Minaj secured the number one spot on the storied list with their new "Say So" remix, marking the first time either artist has ever done so.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It also marks the first time in almost six years that a song by two solo women artists has earned the title, following "Fancy" by Iggy Azalea and Charli XCX in 2014. Black female solo artists who've shared a number one hit before include Lil' Kim and Mya, who shared the win with Christina Aguilera and P!nk for "Lady Marmalade" in 2001, and Brandy and Monica for "The Boy Is Mine" in 1998.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though this is Minaj's first time at number one, the artist has graced the Hot 100 list 109 times, the most among women in the Billboard chart's history. The closest she came to the top of the list before yesterday was in 2014 with "Anaconda," which peaked at number two.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Close behind "Say So" is another hit remix by a powerhouse pair: "Savage" from Megan Thee Stallion featuring Beyoncé. The rap collaboration from the two Houston natives, which was released the same week as Doja and Minaj's track, benefits vulnerable communities from the artists' hometown in Texas during the coronavirus pandemic. This is the first top 10 entry for Stallion and Beyoncé's 19th. Aside from the two duos, the only other woman on the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="top 10 this week" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">top 10 this week</a> is Dua Lipa with "Don't Start Now."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After the news broke yesterday, fans also pointed out that the combination of "Say So" and "Savage" landing number one and two on the Billboard Hot 100 marked the first time in history that four Black women have topped the rankings. Billboard has not yet confirmed the statistic, but it's a moment in music worth celebrating nonetheless. Plus, the fact that both songs fall under rap and hip-hop genres, in which women are often overlooked in comparison to their male counterparts, makes the wins ever sweeter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And to those who think this is an opportunity to compare women's accomplishments, Doja has a message for you. "Obviously, women have been pitted against each other, and this is f---ing so not that," she said during an Instagram Live yesterday, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9375814/doja-cat-say-so-hot-100-no-1-reaction?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&__twitter_impression=true" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Billboard class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Billboard</a>.
