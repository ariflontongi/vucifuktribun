In the 2-minute clip, we see newly minted "A-list" actress Anna Alcott (played by returning AHS star Emma Roberts) on her journey to conceiving a baby with her husband. Her friend and mentor (or perhaps her publicist?) Siobhan Walsh (played by Kardashian) gives Anna advice and at one point asks whether she wants an Oscar as much as she wants a baby. (Spoiler alert: she says yes.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once she and her husband find out their efforts were successful, Anna begins having horrifying dreams about the baby and creepy medical professionals performing gruesome procedures on her. At one point, Kardashian's Siobhan even admits that Anna has "a peculiar penchant for turning dreams into nightmares."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of FX</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the dreams start to affect her IRL, her husband blames the drugs she's on and tells her to "stop being hysterical." But at one point, both her and Siobhan happen upon a broken mirror that reads "Don't do it Anna," suggesting that Siobhan is also privy to the hair-raising turn of events. Anna also starts to be followed by a mysterious woman (played be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cara Delevingne</a>) who later doubles as a nurse who won't let Anna look at her ultrasound. Siobhan later attempts to calm a sleeping Anna by singing a chilling rendition of "Rock-a-Bye-Baby" (which notoriously has disturbing lyrics).</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of FX</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kardashian makes her scripted television debut alongside AHS veteran Roberts, franchise newcomer Delevingne, and a star-studded cast that includes Billie Lourd, Matt Czurchy, Michaela Ja√© Rodriguez, Denis O'Hare, and Leslie Grossman. According to EW, Zachary Quinto is also expected to return to the AHS universe this season. The new season will be available to stream Sept. 20 on Hulu, just in time to get into the Halloween spirit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdllaK6onnRqJmeqqSoeqK5xKugnJmeYrWwvtGoqWarpKS%2FunnDnqOim5Gpsm7A0ZqgpZ2iYoR6gpVsaHI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
