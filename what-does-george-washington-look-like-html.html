Looks</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:64><span>Ah,</span><span> George Washington.</span><span> The man,</span><span> the myth,</span><span> the...</span><span> powdered wig?</span><span> We all know him as the stoic Founding Father on the dollar bill,</span><span> but what did this revolutionary leader actually look like in the flesh?</span><span> Buckle up,</span><span> history buffs (and those just curious about presidential fashion),</span><span> because we're about to delve into the fascinating,</span><span> and sometimes hilarious,</span><span> world of George's visage.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:2><strong>Forehead Like a Five-Dollar Bill (But Hopefully Less Wrinkled)</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:67><span>Let's start with the top floor.</span><span> Thankfully,</span><span> unlike the ever-present image on our currency,</span><span> descriptions tell us George wasn't perpetually creased with worry.</span><span> Most accounts mention a </span><strong>broad forehead</strong><span>,</span><span> hinting at a man of intelligence (though some might say that's a given for the guy who led a whole new nation).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:40><strong>Eyes: Baby Blues or Piercing Grays?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:148><span>Here's where things get interesting.</span><span> Some folks swore George had </span><strong>piercing blue eyes</strong><span>,</span><span> while others claimed they were a calmer </span><strong>gray</strong><span>.</span><span> Maybe it depended on how well you'd behaved lately?</span><span> Either way,</span><span> these peepers were apparently framed by </span><strong>heavy brows</strong><span>,</span><span> giving him a look that could be both commanding and thoughtful.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:50><strong>The Nose Knows (Exactly How Important You Are)</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:242><span>Apparently,</span><span> George wasn't shy in the nose department.</span><span> Most descriptions mention a rather </span><strong>prominent, Roman nose</strong><span>,</span><span> which in those days was seen as a sign of importance (although these days,</span><span> maybe it just means you sniff out a good bargain).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:38><strong>The Rest: A Mosaic of Descriptions</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:300><span>The rest of George's face gets a bit more subjective.</span><span> We hear about a </span><strong>firm jaw</strong><span> (perfect for decisive leadership!</span><span>),</span><span> </span><strong>high cheekbones</strong><span> (giving him a bit of a regal air),</span><span> and a </span><strong>large mouth</strong><span> that was usually kept </span><strong>firmly closed</strong><span> (though some accounts mention a surprisingly disarming smile).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:48><strong>Fact Check: Debunking the Wig Misconceptions</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:127><span>Yes,</span><span> George did wear wigs,</span><span> as was the fashion of the time.</span><span> But here's the shocker:</span><span> contrary to popular belief,</span><span> his hair wasn't actually made of wood!</span><span> More likely,</span><span> it was crafted from </span><strong>horsehair</strong><span> or even </span><strong>human hair</strong><span>.</span><span> So,</span><span> the next time you see a dollar bill,</span><span> remember,</span><span> George might have had a surprisingly stylish mane under that powdered cover.</span></p><h2 data-sourcepos=25:1-25:40>So, What Did George REALLY Look Like?</h2><p data-sourcepos=27:1-27:248><span>The truth is,</span><span> we'll never know for sure exactly what George looked like in real life.</span><span> There were no photographs back then,</span><span> and even portraits can be a bit flattering (especially when you're commissioning a painting to hang above your fireplace).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=29:1-29:329><span>But one thing's for sure:</span><span> the descriptions we have paint a picture of a </span><strong>tall, commanding figure</strong><span> with a strong face that demanded respect.</span><span> He may not have been conventionally handsome by today's standards,</span><span> but there's no doubt he had a certain gravitas that helped him lead a revolution and become the face of a new nation.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=31:1-31:16><strong>How-To FAQs:</strong></p><ul data-sourcepos=33:1-33:1><li
