While one may expect the New York native to opt for a pair of Timbs on his feet, instead, he threw on a pair of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kanye West</a>-designed <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Yeezy</a> boots.</p><p><h6>Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Waiting on the snow," Joe captioned his photos, taken in the streets of the Big Apple. Before long, dozens of the "Deep" rapper's friends flocked to the comments â€“ some of them hyping him up, and others taking the opportunity to clown their pal.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"[You] went [too] far lol," N.O.R.E. wrote.

"Wow [you] really live a life, naw but for real," DJ Khaled added.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Remy Ma, on the other hand, complimented Fat Joe on his "fire fit," while Tony Sunshine asked, "why you doing 'em like that?" along with a trail of flame emojis.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As&nbsp;HipHopDX notes, the&nbsp;Family Ties hitmaker has reacted well to all of the jokes, even reposting some memes that have been made to his own page. "Nah y'all gotta relax," he captioned a photo dump that begins with a photoshopped light sabre in the recording artist's hand and ends with him joining a scene from&nbsp;Mad Max.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check the hilarious posts out below.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
