The post came shortly on the heels of the announcement that she was cast as Lily Bloom in the highly-anticipated movie adaptation of Colleen Hoover's best-selling book It Ends With Us. Lively keyed in followers that the color swap probably had something to do with her new gig by playing Smashing Pumpkin‘s song "Lily (My One and Only)" in the background.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the shot, Lively wore a black, strappy tank top and finished off her glam with a pinkish-red lip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier in the day, the novel's author announced the major casting news in a TikTok video, during which she visited her childhood home, explaining what it represented to her. She told fans that the book was "loosely inspired" by her mother who left a bad relationship to keep her family safe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Our Lily is going to be played by Blake Lively," she said before smiling and exclaiming, "Blake Lively, y'all! She's my dream Lily." The author went on to share that Justin Baldoni, who is also set to direct the film, will be playing the role of Ryle. "I just thought he had what it takes to play that character," she said. "I think that Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively have what it takes to bring these characters to life, and I cannot wait for you guys to see that happen."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lively is booked and busy with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>second installment of her campy 2018 film </a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>A Simple Favor</a> also on the way. Her co-star in the film, Anna Kendrick (who plays the Stephanie to Lively's Emily), recently shared new details about the sequel with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>E! News</a>. “We’ve actually read the script now, and it’s so good,” she said. “Sort of older and wiser [but] at the same time, there are qualities that a person just can’t really change about themselves.” Not to mention Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>expecting their fourth child together</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2ilka6vprjLoqWeZaOgxm60yKCfZqWRqLCivsBmrKWskQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
