He's currently gearing up to drop a new album, believed to be titled&nbsp;I Am Music&nbsp;or&nbsp;Music. It's expected in full sometime this month. He's already given fans a taste of what's to come with "2024," "H00DBYAIR," "Over," and more. Most recently, he even joined forces with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a> for <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"BACKR00MS."</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite having his hands full, the Atlanta-born MC spent his evening at a strip club recently. He shared some photos from the night out on Instagram, and they're even wilder than followers would expect. He's seen wearing a floor-length fur jacket on a stage flooded with cash, wielding a chainsaw alongside several dancers. “CHAINSAW N CLUB IS CR*ZY CHAT,” the photos are captioned. It remains unclear why exactly Playboi Carti decided to bring a power tool to the club, but based on his comments section, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">fans think it's "iconic."</a></p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-playboi-carti-s-night-out>Playboi Carti's Night Out</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Playboi Carti continues to build anticipation for his upcoming release, and fans can't wait to hear what else he has up his sleeve. Some of them were recently left disappointed, however, amid rumors that he's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">rescheduling select dates</a> on his Antagonist tour. A screenshot from the Orlando Kia Center's website started making its rounds on social media today, which lists his January 25 performance as postponed. Moreover, all previously listed tour dates have been removed from his own website, only compounding speculation.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He's yet to confirm or deny plans to postpone additional tour dates, but it wouldn't be the first time he kept fans waiting. Playboi Carti already rescheduled his Antagonist tour once, unveiling its <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">most current set of dates</a> back in August.
