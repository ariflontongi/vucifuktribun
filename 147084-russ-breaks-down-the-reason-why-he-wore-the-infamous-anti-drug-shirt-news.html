While many applaud his music and his business practices, he rubs people wrong with some of his commentary of hip hop and society. Last year, the rapper faced a whole lot of backlash after he shared a photo of himself wearing a shirt that read, "How much xans and lean do you have to do before you realize you're a fucking loser." The rapper had good intentions but the comments came across as insensitive. Nearly a year later, the rapper clarified exactly what he meant when he wore that shirt.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Russ joined the cast of "Everyday Struggle" yesterday and spoke more in-depth about the infamous anti-drug shirt that caused an uproar on the internet. The "Sore Losers" rapper explained that the message he wasn't aimed towards people who use drugs to cope with mental health issues but rather&nbsp;white kids who think it's cool to indulge in the same drugs they hear in rap lyrics.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"A lot of times my message, I be thinkin' that the ones I'm talkin' to, they know I'm talking to them so it's like a misunderstanding," he said. "Who I was talking to was the white kids who don't really be having any real problems. They be doing that shit recreationally... I grew up with a lot of kids who'd be doing that shit because at the party, you be thinkin' that's the cool shit to do and next thing you know, you're addicted because you heard that shit in a song."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He added, "That's who I was talking to. I wasn't talking to people [who have] PTSD."</p><p>Check the clip below with Russ' bit on the shirt starting at the 27:25 mark.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
