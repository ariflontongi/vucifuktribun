The musical festival posted footage of the performance, which took place during the second day of the festival’s second weekend, to its official Instagram account.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Zendaya acknowledged the fact that it’s been years since the Euphoria star appeared on stage to sing live during a scheduled set in an Instagram Story discussing the “magical” night. “Thank you all for welcoming me back on that stage with open arms. It’s been a very long time, so I appreciate it,” she said in one story she recorded in the early hours after her performance before heading to bed.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In that same video, the actress and producer discussed the overwhelming response to her appearance on the stage while thanking the “gorgeous” crowd for coming. “I have never heard screaming like that in my entire life. As soon as I turned the corner, I couldn’t hear anything,” she recalled of the “special” and “so, so cool” moment, which saw the crowd sing along. “I don’t know what happened. I don’t know what I sounded like but I just was like, ‘You know what? I’m just going to have fun.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I just want to say thank you again for such a magical beautiful night,” she added, referencing an earlier story featuring a written statement. “Thank you to Lab for inviting me and making all this happen so last minute.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In that written statement, Zendaya thanked Labrinth, for giving her the “most beautiful safe space” for her return to the stage. She also thanked the crowd, again, for their “love” and support, which she wrote “made all my nerves melt away.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In response, Labrinth&nbsp;reshared the statement to their own Instagram Story. “Thank you for blessing the stage with your fire energy!!” the British singer, rapper, songwriter and record producer wrote. “This was a celebration of new beginnings and growth.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Both Zendaya and Labrinth play a major role in the music of Euphoria, with the latter serving as the HBO show’s composer and producer of its original score. The two collaborated on multiple songs from the show, including the Emmy-nominated “Still Don’t Know My Name” — which Labrinth co-wrote the lyrics to with the actress and Muzhda Zemar-McKenzie — as well as&nbsp;the breakout hit “All For Us,” which he sings with Zendaya.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Labrinth’s work on the series’ original music has garnered him four Emmy nominations and one win in the outstanding original music and lyrics category for “All for Us.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">This is not the first time during this year’s Coachella that Labrinth has made headlines with a surprise appearance.
