It’s the first time the outfit has presented at the show.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">David is set to hit theaters Nov. 21, 2025. According to a logline from Angel, the movie is a “joyful animated musical about the life of the ancient prophet, poet and king. After one young shepherd boy is chosen to battle a giant, this chosen one goes on to inspire an entire nation of believers. Coming to the big screen, this underdog story full of adventure and hope is for every giant slayer out there.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Angel executives also walked exhibitors through its upcoming slate and release dates. Hoping to repeat the magic of Sound of Freedom, the company will open Possum Trot on July 4 of this year, the same day Sound opened and famously beat the latest Indiana Jones movie for the day. Inspired by a true story, Possum Trot follows Donna and Reverend Martin as they lead the charge to prove that faith, community and perseverance have the power to change the lives of children everywhere after 22 families from their church adopted 77 children.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Bonhoeffer opens Nov. 22. The film is based on the life of pacifist Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who preached love while plotting the assassination of an evil tyrant.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Angel has a busy year-end calendar. Homestead, about the actions of a small town when the world erupts in postapocalyptic chaos, launches Dec. 20.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Utah-based company, run by three Mormon brothers, is proud to work outside of the Hollywood system. It crowdsources its projects and uses a unique “pay it forward” system that allows people to buy tickets for others. Angel was involved in the creation of the hit Jesus miniseries The Chosen but is far less so now.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In its first year as a theatrical distributor, Angel topped $300 million in global ticket sales, with more than $185 million of that coming from Sound of Freedom. Its movies since then, such as Cabrini ($19 million), have done far less business.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We are eternally grateful to our theatrical partners who helped champion our studio and enabled us to bring films that amplify light into movie theaters,” shares Brandon Purdie, president of Angel Studios’ theatrical distribution. “There is no better place than CinemaCon to celebrate and give credit to our exhibition partners.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKK6xp6jZqukqrGqu9Jmm5qumZl6orrIppitnZRis6q4zGaaoqaVoq6ku81maGtrZW2EcnyPaWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
