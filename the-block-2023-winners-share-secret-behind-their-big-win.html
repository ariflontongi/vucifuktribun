As soon as you find out you’re on the Block, why would you call an auctioneer?”</p><p>“For us, it was the end game. There was a lot of thought that went into that. The team at Ray Way Sunbury are exceptional.”</p><p>The Sydney-based couple also revealed that building their home came to an end, they made the decision to stick around in Melbourne for three months to keep networking with potential buyers.</p><p>Their strategy worked like a charm, and in the end they sold their home to Adrian ‘Mr Lambo’ Portelli for a cool $5 million.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Since securing their win they’ve both been in high spirits, and are already excited about a possible reunion with the rest of their castmates.</p><p>“All couples are such good friends. We’re looking forward to the many reunions that we will be having if not yearly, monthly,” added the pair. “We’ve left with amazing friendships. We had this really unique bond and respect for each other and I think everyone should know that.”</p><p>Meanwhile, with the addition of $100,000 in prize money, Steph and Gian, both 27, are now $1.75 million richer. Not bad for a few months work!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmS%2Fpq3LoquyZaSrfLW0xGaZpaeToHpzfJFsZLChnqOys7%2BMrJ%2BaqpViwKav0Z6rZpqVnbavsIytn56homKvqrOMsKCnZ56axLR50q2mq7Ffl4B1sI9vnZtplW6zcYLEn5pqb5SbgHOEwGpnn5qUmn0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
