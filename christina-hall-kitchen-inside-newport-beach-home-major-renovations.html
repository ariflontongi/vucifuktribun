Christina took to her Instagram Stories on Wednesday to reveal the space's very different look. Instead of pristine worktops and an immaculately decorated space, the room is now covered with blue tape, protective plastic covering, and lots of tools.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7da0eq6NSM data-wc=23>The vision is certainly there though, and Christina appears to be happy with the progress as she captioned the image: <strong data-gid=elNV_GJr9by>"Slowly… But surely…"&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/19fc8b6cb33a-christina-hall-kitchen-before.jpg><p id=eel1XALaTR data-wc=54>A new center island appears to have been built to fill the space but at the moment it is unfinished, and all the mismatched wood can still be seen. The backsplash behind where the stove will be is covered in tape and paper, with only a large black extractor fan cooker hood on show.</p><p id=ed_T7lbFr0j data-wc=19>Earlier this month, Christina <a class=hm-link href=#>vented her frustrations</a> over having no kitchen, which you can <strong>see in the video below.</strong>&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Christina Hall shares frustration over makeshift family kitchen</figure><p id=erxlflNe0i data-wc=53>The home was purchased by Christina and her husband <a class=hm-link href=#>Josh Hall&nbsp;</a>in 2022. "Celebrating and settling in," she captioned her Instagram post in June that year, as she shared how they "made a wish list of every single thing we wanted in a home and then the next day this is off market".<br></p><p id=eULgu0XS70g data-wc=50>Christina is mom to three kids: she shares Hudson with her ex, <a class=hm-link href=#>Ant Anstead</a>, and Brayden and daughter Taylor, 12, with her first ex-husband, <strong>Tarek El Moussa.</strong> She married Josh in 2022. They moved from Dana Point back to Newport Beach last year to settle into a "long-term family home".&nbsp;</p><p id=e58vT_HSAM8 data-wc=70>"We moved to Dana Point last summer after falling in love with the ocean view,” the 39-year-old wrote on Instagram in April 2022. "We still LOVE the view, but among other things, we don't love the 90-minute round trip drive to and from the kids' school. Back to Newport we go. Near school, friends and work.” The family also has a beautiful <a class=hm-link href=#>Nashville farmhouse</a>, which she purchased in late 2021.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2d2f9c10ee12-christina-hall-joshua-kids.jpg><p id=eQFgzEztgF data-wc=58>The star recently spoke to <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">People&nbsp;</a>about dealing with criticism and negativity on social media regarding her personal and family life. She opened up about how naysayers have come after her for her frequent marriages (she's been married three times) and her decision to make her children an active part of her social presence.&nbsp;</p><p id=erg2SB5UxRA data-wc=62>"I allow myself a little time to be upset," the 39-year-old stated to the publication, although she said the one person consistently in her corner was Joshua. "And usually the things that upset me are when people make direct statements about things they have no idea about. Sometimes that'll really irritate me and then I'll talk to [my husband Joshua] about it."&nbsp;</p><p id=esbBaOGRzl data-wc=67>She continued: "The thing is, people already have a preconceived notion in their head. You could literally show them the truth and they could still be like, no, that's not the truth. "I think the older I get, the less I care. I'm approaching 40 in a few months and what I've heard is, in your forties, you're the most confident and comfortable in your own skin."</p><p id=eSvz3ABlCd data-wc=11><strong>See more photos of Christina and Joshua Hall's family home below...</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ef39e7c037f4-christina-hall-home-hgtv.jpg><br><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a7d2140c2ee9-christina-hall-home.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4996fd6ceda5-christina-hall-pool.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/04053aa50696-christina-hall-children-taylor-hudson-brayden.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/13fa1ee30356-christina-hall-backyard-newport-beach.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a13a194df4f0-christina-hall-family-news-flip-or-flop-fans-are-amazed-husband-z.jpg><p id=efLSFa8Uda data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
