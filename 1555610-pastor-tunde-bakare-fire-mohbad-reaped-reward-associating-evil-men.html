Tell him.”<p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@SAMKLEF</a></p>Tunde Bakare's actions are even more concerning to me than those of Naira Marley. I, SAMKLEF, was once a member of the Latter Rain Children's Choir in 1993, in one of the branches near Ikare Bus Stop, Agbado Oke Aro.It deeply troubles me that when some pastors were gaining popularity and the love of the congregation, Tunde Bakare made the decision to shut down all the branches, seemingly to consolidate his control, instructing everyone to attend only the Ikeja branch. This behavior reminds me of the Pharisees that Jesus spoke about in the Bible – they simply rebranded their actions.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/04ce683401d77c63.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Olamide sing-alike Maro stuns many with tribute to Mohbad: "Na you steal Baddo voice successfully"</span></p></a>I firmly believe that SAMKLEF observes and understands everything that's happening.Cc @DaddyFRZ see meat<h2>Pastor Bakare says Mohbad reaped what he sowed</h2><p class=align-left>Earlier, <strong>Legit.ng</strong> reported that former presidential aspirant, <a href=# rel=noopener>Pastor Tunde Bakare</a>, has waded into the conversation surrounding the tragic and mysterious demise of the late Nigerian rapper, Ileriolu­wa Aloba, known as MohBad.</p><p class=align-left>During his sermon in Leicester, United Kingdom, at the 2nd an­niversary of The Envoy Nation, Pastor Bakare said the late <a href=#>reaped the reward of his actions</a> while alive.</p><h2>Police exhume Mohbad’s remains, begin autopsy</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, Legit.ng reported that operatives of the <a href=#>Lagos State</a> Police Command have finally <a href=#>exhumed the corpse </a>of the late singer Mohbad.</p><p class=align-left>The state police spokesperson, Benjamin Hundeyin, disclosed this in a post on X, formerly Twitter, @BenHundeyin.</p><p class=align-left>Hundeyin said the corpse had been exhumed and next is to carry out an autopsy on it.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdku6qzxKugmmdhaoJ2gpBpZKmZo6m8s3nTrqWdnV2Xrqyt0Z5kn6Gimnquu8ebmJ1lopqusbHDZqmer5GnsW6t0qymnKGRqbavs4yeraKkXaKyr3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
