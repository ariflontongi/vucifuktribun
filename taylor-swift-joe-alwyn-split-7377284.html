Sources told the publication that the split was amicable and "not dramatic," adding that their relationship "had just run its course."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another insider close to Swift and Alwyn <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>confirmed the breakup</a> to People.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swift and Alwyn began seeing each other in late 2016, but they did their best to keep their relationship out of the spotlight and managed to do so until May 2017. Alwyn first broke his silence about Swift being his girlfriend during an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>British Vogue</a> in 2018, but refused to share any further details about their romance. “I’m aware people want to know about that side of things,” he said. “I think we have been successfully very private and that has now sunk in for people … but I really prefer to talk about work.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Taylor also addressed their decision to keep things private. “I’ve learned that if I do, people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion,” Swift told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a> in 2019. “If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we’d be talking about it — but it’s just that it goes out into the world. That’s where the boundary is, and that’s where my life has become manageable. I really want to keep it feeling manageable.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's not to say that Swift didn't offer fans any glimpses into their courtship. Many songs from her 2017 album reputation are about Joe — including "Gorgeous,' "Call It What You Want," and "Delicate." Meanwhile, the opening track on her Midnights album, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"Lavender Haze,"</a> is also inspired by her and Alwyn's low-key romance and the lengths they go to shield their love story from the public.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZKOnlWKurcPYp2SsqJyewW6DknBua3Bk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
